"In the third circuit, how do courts calculate rent on a triple net lease?","Section 502(b)(6) caps a landlord's claim in bankruptcy for damages resulting from the termination of a real property lease.16 Under § 502(b)(6), a landlord-creditor is entitled to rent reserved from the greater of (1) one lease year or (2) fifteen percent, not to exceed three years, of the remaining lease term. The cap operates from the earlier of the petition filing date or ""the date on which [the] lessor repossessed or the lessee surrendered, the leased property."" The landlord also retains a claim for any unpaid rent due under such lease prior to the earlier of those dates. This language reflects Congress's intent to limit lease termination claims to prevent landlords from receiving a windfall over other creditors. See H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, at 353 (1977), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6309 (""[The cap] limits the damages allowable to a landlord of the debtor.... It is designed to compensate the landlord for his loss while not permitting a claim so large (based on a long-term lease) as to prevent other general unsecured creditors from recovering a dividend from the estate.

"Is allowing the preference period to expire a fraudulent transfer in bankruptcy?","(a)(1) The trustee may avoid any transfer (including any transfer to or for the benefit of an insider under an employment contract) of an interest of the debtor in property, or any obligation (including any obligation to or for the benefit of an insider under an employment contract) incurred by the debtor, that was made or incurred on or within 2 years before the date of the filing of the petition, if the debtor voluntarily or involuntarily—  (A) made such transfer or incurred such obligation with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became, on or after the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, indebted; or  (B)(i) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation; and  (ii)(I) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or became insolvent as a result of such transfer or obligation;  (II) was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a transaction, for which any property remaining with the debtor was an unreasonably small capital;  (III) intended to incur, or believed that the debtor would incur, debts that would be beyond the debtor's ability to pay as such debts matured; or  (IV) made such transfer to or for the benefit of an insider, or incurred such obligation to or for the benefit of an insider, under an employment contract and not in the ordinary course of business."

"Is intellectual property subject to sale or auction in bankruptcy filings?","Business Justification. ODC has articulated sufficient and sound business reasons for entering into the Agreement and consummating the Sale Transaction outside a plan of reorganization. It is a reasonable exercise of ODC’s business judgment to consummate the Sale Transaction. J. Best Interests. Approval of the Agreement and the consummation of the Sale Transaction are in the best interests of ODC, its estate and creditors, and other parties-in interest under applicable bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy law. K. Highest or Otherwise Best. The Purchaser’s bid for the Acquired Intellectual Property, as memorialized in the Agreement, is the highest or otherwise best offer received for the Intellectual Property and will provide a greater recovery for ODC’s creditors than would be provided by any other practical available alternative. The purchase price to be paid by the Purchaser pursuant to the Agreement is fair consideration and constitutes reasonably equivalent value under applicable bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy law for the Acquired Intellectual Property, as determined by the marketing and auction process. L. Arm’s-Length Transaction. The Agreement was negotiated, proposed and entered into by ODC and the Purchaser without collusion, in good faith and from arm’s-length bargaining positions. Although the Purchaser is an “insider” of ODC under section 101(31) of the Bankruptcy Code, neither ODC nor the Purchaser have engaged in any conduct that would cause or permit the Agreement to be avoided or be the basis for an award for monetary damages under Bankruptcy Code section 363(n). Specifically, the Purchaser has not acted in a collusive manner with any person and the purchase price was not controlled by any Agreement among bidders. M. Good Faith. All of the actions taken by the Purchaser and its officers, directors, employees, counsel and other professionals in connection with the Agreement, the auction process and this proceeding have been taken in good faith. The Purchaser is a good faith purchaser of the Acquired Intellectual Property within the meaning of Bankruptcy Code section 363(m) and is entitled to all of the protections afforded thereby. The Purchaser proceeded in good faith in all respects in connection with the Sale Transaction in that: (i) the Purchaser recognized that ODC was free to deal with any other party interested in acquiring the Acquired Intellectual Property; (iii) the Purchaser complied with the provisions in the Bidding Procedures Order; (iv) the Purchaser agreed to subject its bid to the competitive bidding procedures set forth in the Bidding Procedures Order; and (v) all payments to be made by the Purchaser pursuant to the Agreement in connection with the Sale Transaction have been disclosed."
"What is the standard for recharacterizing a sale-leaseback transaction of real property in the third circuit?","A threshold problem confronting us is the standard of review. Sunray asserts that the Tax Court based its decision on findings of fact, which included a finding as to the parties' intent, and that these findings are binding upon us unless clearly erroneous. The record in the instant case, however, rests substantially on an indisputed record, consisting principally of stipulations of the underlying facts and appended exhibits, including the leases at issue. The basic rights, duties, and economic interests of the parties are essentially not in dispute. The dispute centers around the characterization for income tax purposes of the letter and lease agreements. The oral testimony offered by each of the parties was either expert testimony interpreting the documents or background testimony of some of the principals pertaining to the negotiations and their views of the transaction. In [Citation omitted], we held the ""interpretation and construction of a contract is a question of law and that the interpretation by the Tax Court is reviewable by this court."" Of course, the subjective intent of the parties may be a consideration in interpreting an agreement where the documents are ambiguous or incomplete and, in such circumstances, the court's determination of the unexplained subjective intent is a finding of fact. When, however, the documents embodying the transaction are clear and complete, ""the court is called upon to interpret the documents, and from their substance, to characterize the transaction for tax purposes as a matter of law."" [Citation omitted]. Regardless of whether the parties honestly believe the transaction to be a lease, where the documents they have executed fully embody the elements of their bargain it is the documents themselves, not the parties' conceptions of them, which must govern the legal characterization of the transaction. See [Citation omitted]. We view the question here as essentially legal, not factual, and fully reviewable by this court. [Citation omitted]. IV. In the usual mortgage transaction between a debtor and creditor, the funds advanced to the debtor are secured by a lien on his property. The debtor agrees to repay the funds over a fixed term together with specified interest for their use; generally, the ownership of property does not change hands. The usual business bargain between a commercial lessor and lessee is far more complex. Real estate interests between a lessor and lessee normally are divided into a number of parts, each of which represents an ownership interest in property. In order to sort out these interests, the following pragmatic approach has recently been suggested: If the characterization for federal income tax law purposes of the interests of a lessor and a lessee is to be determined in a manner consistent with business realities, the inquiry must change from ""Who is the owner of the property for tax purposes?"" to ""Are the ownership interests of lessor and lessee as characterized by the parties consistent with traditional substantive business bargains between lessors and lessees?"" Rosenberg & Weinstein, Sale-Leasebacks: An Analysis of These Transactions After The Lyon Decision, 45 J. of Tax, 146, 148 (1976). In the instant case, the actual conveyance to the Trust of title to the properties and the fair market value of the prices assigned to them does not appear to be an issue. Although Sunray argues that the presence of fair market value as a consideration for the transfer distinguishes the instant case from [Citation omitted]; and [Citation omitted], we doubt that this is a controlling consideration.  We deem much more significant the relationships of the parties after the transfer of the properties as a result of the burdens, benefits, and risks imposed on each of them by the terms and conditions of their lease agreements. In determining whether the sale-leaseback transactions in the instant case created the traditionally bargained for business relationships between owner and lessee or whether Sunray in fact retained an equity in the real estate despite the conveyances, we look to the economic realities of the leases and not to the labels applied by the parties. In [Citation omitted], the taxpayer claimed depreciation on three buildings in which it operated a department store, the legal title to two of which and the assignment of a 99 year lease to the third it had transferred to a bank as trustee for certain land trust-certificate holders. The trustee had at the same time leased all three back to the taxpayer for 99 years with options to renew and purchase. The taxpayer claimed depreciation as a deduction because it bore the capital loss from wear, tear, and exhaustion of the buildings. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction on the ground that the statutory right to depreciation follows legal title. The Court of Tax Appeals, however, allowed the deduction, concluding that the transaction between the taxpayer and the trustee bank was in reality a mortgage loan; that the conveyance of title to the bank was actually given merely as security for a loan and that the ""rent"" stipulated in the leaseback was intended as a promise to pay an agreed 5 percent interest on the loan. The circuit and Supreme Courts affirmed, the Supreme Court noting that in the field of taxation the courts are ""concerned with substance and realities, and formal written documents are not rigidly binding.""[Citation omitted]."
"Is it a fraudulent conveyance to delay filing a bankruptcy petition until after 90 days to insulate creditor from preference liability?","The New York Debtor and Creditor Law applies a standard for constructive fraud that is generally similar to that in section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, but with subtle differences. Much like the provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(1)(B)(ii)(I), for example, Debtor and Creditor Law § 273 states that “[e]very conveyance made ... by a person who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent is fraudulent as to creditors without regard to his actual intent if the conveyance is made ... without a fair consideration.” However, an important distinction involves the concept of consideration. To avoid a constructively fraudulent transfer under section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, a trustee must show that the debtor “received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer.” 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(1)(B)(i). On the other hand, to establish a fraudulent conveyance under any of the constructive fraud provisions of the New York State statute (Debtor and Creditor Law §§ 273, 273–a, 274 and 275), the trustee needs only to demonstrate the absence of “a fair consideration.” As defined by Debtor and Creditor Law § 272(a), fair consideration requires not only an exchange for fair equivalent or proportionate value, but also that the transfer be “in good faith.” Even when a debtor receives equivalent value for his transfer, therefore, New York law will allow a bankruptcy trustee to avoid a constructively fraudulent transfer that is made other than in good faith. Here again, the parties have stipulated to Northstar's insolvency at the time of nearly all of the payments to Buchheit. As consideration for these payments, Buchheit cancelled an identical amount of indebtedness. Still, with any absence of good faith, the New York Debtor and Creditor Law presumes an absence of fair consideration and will allow the trustee to avoid the transaction. As a general rule in New York for purposes of fraudulent conveyance law, the payment of an unsecured debt to an insider is deemed to be without good faith, and therefore lacking in fair consideration. In [Citation omitted], the Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment avoiding this kind of fraudulent conveyance, “for the reasons stated in the opinion by Justice Moses M. Weinstein.” Writing for a unanimous panel of the Appellate Division, Justice Weinstein held “that preferential transfers to directors, officers and shareholders of insolvent corporations in derogation of the rights of general creditors do not fulfill the good-faith requirement of the Debtor and Creditor Law.” [Citation omitted]. Consequently, “[t]he shareholders cannot be considered bona fide purchasers for fair consideration who are immune from liability as transferees of fraudulently conveyed property, as the record reveals that they were aware that they were receiving money from [the debtor] when the claims of the general creditors had not been completely paid and, in fact, they consented to such a distribution of the corporate funds.” [Citation omitted]. Presumably in recognition of the holdings in [Citation omitted] and in other similar cases, the defendant's counsel recommended that Buchheit return the various payments that he had received on account of unsecured obligations."
"Can an insider purchase the debt of a bankrupt company?","The Bankruptcy Court held that CVC's intention was to benefit from its position as a director of Papercraft by purchasing claims at a discount. The Bankruptcy Court concluded that CVC had not carried out its ""fiduciary obligation to act in the best interest of Papercraft and its estate because it had purchased claims without first providing Papercraft with the opportunity to make the purchases.""         The Bankruptcy Court noted further that CVC's conduct had resulted in at least three adverse effects. First, the selling noteholders would have received a total distribution of $15,989,676.56 under the plan rather than the amount paid by CVC of $10,553,541.88 if they had decided not to sell after full disclosure by CVC. Although the noteholders may have still elected to sell after full disclosure, the harm lies in the fact that they ""were deprived of the ability to make a fully informed decision concerning the sale of their claims.""          Second, ""CVC's actions diluted the voting rights of prepetition creditors and resulted in CVC's attempt to wrest from the prepetition creditors the valuable assets of Papercraft."" The Bankruptcy Court pointed out that without full disclosure the market for claims suffers as an efficient market requires that both buyers and sellers have access to information so that all parties to the transaction can be adequately informed. Also, ""because only the name of the transferee of record need be disclosed, parties in interest will be unable to ascertain who the real claims buyer is and the intentions of that claims buyer with respect to the control of a debtor.""          Lastly, CVC actions created a conflict of interest which jeopardized its ability ""to make future decisions of claims as a director free of its own personal interests as an owner of claims. Adding to the conflict is the fact these purchases were made at a discount from present value. This brings into play a profit motive, accentuating its personal interests.""[Citation Omitted].         As a result, the Bankruptcy Court created and applied a per se rule which prohibits a debtor's insiders from purchasing claims against it without disclosing their identity and relationship with the debtor. The Court held that when claims are purchased by insiders without making such disclosures to the debtor and creditors, ""the insider's newly acquired claim will be limited to the amount paid by the acquiring insider and recovery on the claim will be limited to the percentage distribution provided in the plan, as applied to the allowed claim The Bankruptcy Court concluded that the ""unfairness caused by CVC's conduct would not be adequately addressed absent application of a per se rule."""

"Can a time-barred unsecured claim be used against preference?","This court rejects extending the FDCPA to time-barred proofs of claim. An accurate and complete proof of claim on a time-barred debt is not false, deceptive, misleading, unfair, or unconscionable under the FDCPA. The district court properly dismissed for failure to state a claim."
"What is considered an unjustified refusal to prosecute claims due to a pending settlement agreement in a derivative standing case?","A creditor’s request for derivative standing to bring an estate claim challenges the debtor in possession’s decision not to pursue it. [Citation omitted]. For that challenge to succeed, the creditor must demonstrate that in refusing to pursue the claim, the debtor in possession is shirking its responsibilities to the estate. [Citation omitted]  (noting that derivative standing is appropriate when “the debtor in possession unjustifiably failed to bring suit or abused its discretion in not suing”). The creditor seeking derivative standing therefore bears “the initial burden to allege facts showing that the refusal to file suit is unjustified.” [Citation omitted]. Whether the refusal is justified is gauged in light of a debtor in possession’s statutory obligations and fiduciary duties. One of those duties is to “wisely manage the estate’s legal claims.” [Citation omitted].  But wise management does not mean the debtor in possession must always pursue a claim. Sometimes the better course is to settle. [Citation omitted].  As the court of appeals has observed in these very bankruptcy cases, “successful resolution of disputes . . . is one of the Code’s central objectives.” [Citation omitted] (noting that “[c]hapter 11 has as its central goal the resolution of competing claims to scarce resources by a negotiated plan”).  To determine whether a debtor in possession is justified in deciding not to pursue claims, courts typically conduct a cost-benefit analysis. [Citation omitted]. Among the factors courts consider in conducting this analysis are “‘(1) the probabilities of legal success and financial recovery in event of success; (2) the creditor's proposed fee arrangement; and (3) the anticipated delay and expense to the bankruptcy estate that the initiation and continuation of litigation will likely produce.’” [Citation omitted]. Here, the Committee has not explained in its motion why the debtors’ decision to forego pursuing the claims was unjustified. The Committee has not shown that recovery on the claims is probable or what that recovery might be. Nor has the Committee provided even a rough estimate of how much it might cost to pursue the claims (although the cost would doubtless be considerable). Because the Committee has addressed neither potential recovery nor potential cost, the Committee has not shown that the recovery might justify the cost. Indeed, the Committee barely discusses unjustifiable refusal at all, devoting a single page of its 43-page motion to the question. In that page, the Committee pins its entire argument on the four cash collateral stipulations, asserting that those stipulations make the debtors “incapable of objectively pursuing actions” to avoid the liens. The debtors’ refusal to pursue the claims, in other words, is unjustified because the debtors have refused to pursue them. A tautology is all the Committee offers. Although the Committee’s failure to address unjustifiable refusal would be reason alone to deny the motion, it should be noted that the debtors have supplied an adequate justification for their decision not to pursue the claims. The debtors made that decision, they say, because they favor resolving the claims through a comprehensive plan of reorganization that will provide distributions to creditors. And efforts at such a resolution are under way in earnest, with the parties (including the Committee) about to begin mediation. As the debtors and other objectors point out, prosecution of the proposed amended complaint now could stymie those efforts. The debtors’ decision to forego pursuing the claims in favor of settling them through a plan is a reasonable exercise of the debtors’ judgment. [Citations omitted]  (finding debtor’s refusal to pursue estate’s avoidance claim was justified where debtor sought to treat the claim in its proposed plan). At no point in its motion does the Committee even suggest that the estates would be better off litigating the claims than negotiating their resolution through a plan of reorganization. In fact, the Committee itself recognizes the possibility that “negotiations might consensually resolve” its challenges[Citation omitted]. If the motion is granted, the Committee says, the court should not require the proposed amended complaint to be filed right away or by a certain date. The Committee instead asks leave to file the complaint at its discretion – “to potentially avoid unnecessary litigation if it appears its discussions with the parties may yield progress.” That the litigation could prove unnecessary given the parties’ settlement discussions is justification enough for the debtors’ not to pursue it. [Citation omitted] (holding that this court could enjoin litigation in another court if doing so would promote settlement of disputes in these bankruptcy cases)."
"Is the agreement to provide a credit card a financial accommodation under Section 365(e)(2)(B)?","The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found the overriding purpose of this credit card merchant agreement to be, not financing, but the ""exchange of items."" In re Thomas B. Hamilton Co., 969 F.2d at 1020. In other words, the parties sought to create ""a relationship that would permit the debtor to accept the use by customers of credit cards instead of cash in the course of its business and permit the bank to purchase the sales drafts arising from the resulting credit card transactions."" Id. In fact, other than the bank's incidental right to charge back a sales draft in certain limited circumstances, ""the specific terms of the Agreement did not evidence any intent on the part of the bank to extend credit to the debtor."" Id. The court thus concluded that the agreement did not constitute a financial accommodation under §§ 365(c)(2) and (e)(2)(B). The appellate court made a point to emphasize that ""sound policy considerations support this conclusion,"" particularly since ""the Agreement at issue here is typical of credit card merchant agreements between all kinds of merchants and merchant banks."" [Citation omitted] ""If these agreements may not be assumed by the trustee following a bankruptcy filing, rehabilitation will be virtually impossible for any merchant who relies heavily on credit card sales."" [Citation omitted] Though acknowledging that the level of risk initially accepted by the bank might increase when the merchant files for bankruptcy, the court found two provisions in the Bankruptcy Code to provide adequate protection against ""the forced assumption of unreasonable risks."" [Citation omitted] First, bankruptcy courts have the authority to refuse to ""approve the assumption of a credit card merchant agreement under § 365(a) if the merchant bank demonstrates that continued performance of the agreement would place it at unreasonable risk, such as when the merchant's sales result in an unusually high percentage of chargebacks or when there is some evidence that the merchant is involved in fraud."" [Citation omitted] Second, ""a merchant who has not promptly repaid chargebacks in accordance with the credit card merchant agreement may not assume the agreement under § 365(b) without first curing the default and providing assurance that it can and will promptly repay chargebacks in the future."" [Citation omitted] Notwithstanding the position articulated in Hamilton, Bank One contends that the contract in this matter constituted a financial accommodation made to the debtor's customers for the benefit of the debtor. While the private label revolving credit plan agreement did detail the manner in which Bank One and the debtor would ""exchange items"" (sales drafts for funds), these provisions existed only to further the purpose of financing a qualified customer's purchase of merchandise sold or services rendered by the debtor. (See [Citation omitted].) In other words, while Bank One and the debtor entered into a ""trade"" relationship, their reason for doing so was to create a mechanism by which credit could be extended to third parties. In this way, Bank One could profit from the interest generated when customers chose to pay for their purchases over time, and the debtor could benefit from the increase in sales which credit so often seems to prompt. This argument, however, misses the point. The purpose of §§ 365(c)(2) and (e)(2)(B) is quite simple — to prevent a debtor's financial uncertainty, which necessarily results when a bankruptcy petition is filed, from unfairly elevating the risk to a party who extended credit pre-petition. Within the narrow context of this particular dispute, however, the debtor's ability to fulfill its obligations under the private label revolving credit plan agreement never concerned Bank One. Rather, Bank One has complained that the customers to whom it unilaterally chose to extend credit have breached their credit card agreements — agreements to which the debtor was not a party and over which the debtor had no control. Congress simply did not intend §§ 365(c)(2) and (e)(2)(B) to remedy this kind of collateral damage created when any retail debtor seeks relief under the Bankruptcy Code. The court therefore concludes that the private label revolving credit plan agreement did not constitute a ""financial accommodation"" under 11 U.S.C. §§ 365(c)(2) and (e)(2)(B). As a consequence, Bank One was obligated to continue performing under the agreement, and to continue bearing the loss if any particular account could be neither collected from the customer nor ""charged back"" to the debtor, until its motion for relief from stay was granted effective October 27, 1996. Bank One thus has no ground upon which to argue that the cost of the post-petition increase in the ""uncollectible accounts"" rate on the BestCard should be shifted to the bankruptcy estate and treated as an administrative expense."

"If debtor and creditor enter into a stipulation for the amount on the proof of claim on the date of the petition, can creditor later file a proof of claim for a greater amount than previously agreed upon?","In looking at the “no harm no foul rule”, it appears that the burden should shift to PACCAR to show that the credit applied to the debt is equal to the fair market value of the vehicle. The evidence shows that presale the appraised value of the collateral ranged from $29,150.00 to $32,000.00. All of these values were set by agents of GMC. The stipulated sales price obtained by PACCAR was $34,000.00 which is in excess of the appraised value put on the truck by GMC. Thus, this Court holds that the fair market value to be credited is the sales price of $34,000.00. As evidenced by amended proof of claim no. 13 filed by PACCAR, PACCAR applied the entire $34,000.00 as a credit against the amount owed. The proof of claim shows a contract pay-off balance as of the date of public sale of $56,765.80. This Court holds that the amount of the claim to which PACCAR is entitled is the pay-off balance as of the date of the filing of the Debtor's petition for relief, August 12, 1988. This amount shall be credited by the sum of $34,000.00 and the resulting deficiency shall be allowed as an unsecured claim in this proceeding. Since a deficiency arises, no sale costs are allowable under section 506(b)."
"Is a license agreement made under integrated circumstances between debtor and a 3rd party considered executory or substantially performed?",": I conclude, adopting the reasoning of Lubrizol, that the license agreement at issue here constituted an executory contract within the meaning of § 365(d). The trustee's contentions, that UCRDC's obligation to forbear from granting licenses to others and not to unreasonably withhold permission for sublicensing do not suffice to make the license agreement executory, are not sustainable. The trustee not having sought assumption of the license agreement within 60 days after the entry of the order for relief in this case, the license agreement must be deemed rejected."
"Are state criminal proceedings against the debtor subject to the automatic stay where the creditors contacted the district attorney and initiated those criminal proceedings?","These exceptions do not apply to the facts of this case. Both Mr. Hunter and Mr. Hollers, another individual investor, testified they were pursuing a criminal investigation by the District Attorney as part of their public duty to prevent further frauds being perpetrated on the public, and to see that justice was done, full well knowing that recovery of any amount from the Debtor was most likely impossible. In addition, the Movants hired an experienced criminal attorney, who then made contact with the District Attorney several months prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. Clearly, the motives of these creditors was not based upon hopes of monetary recovery, but based on doing their public duty to see that further alleged frauds by this Debtor do not occur. CONCLUSION Therefore, neither the automatic stay nor the discharge stay, enjoin, or bar the creditors in this case from presenting the underlying facts related to the Debtor's alleged fraudulent procurement of monies to the appropriate prosecutorial and/or crime investigation entities and/or authorities with jurisdiction to review and investigate potential criminal acts of the Debtor. Further, neither does the automatic stay nor the discharge bar the commencement and continuation of any criminal action resulting from any such investigation. The Motion to Determine Automatic Stay Does not Apply is GRANTED."
"Does the bankruptcy court have the authority to modify claims of tax certificate holders in debtor's Chapter 13 plan?","Quote 1: Under the Debtor's Plan, the Debtor seeks to pay the redemption amount to the Purchaser over time as a secured claim under her Plan pursuant to § 1322(b)(2). Section 1322(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, of course, empowers a debtor, through a Chapter 13 plan, to “modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence.” 11 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(2)."
"Should the court grant debtor's objection to the secured claim of a tax certificate holder?","The confirmed Chapter 13 plans in these two cases each specify a principal amount and a fixed rate of interest for the tax creditors' secured claims. The secured creditors are bound by the terms of the respective confirmed plans. For example, in the Slade–Lanier case, the confirmed plan as modified (and not objected to by CapitalSource) provides for the secured claim of CapitalSource to be paid $10,234.59, plus interest at the rate of 18 percent in monthly payments of $312.00. ECF No. 44 at 6; ECF No. 49. “The portion of any allowed claim that exceeds the amount to be paid through the plan shall be treated as an unsecured claim.” Id. Nothing in either confirmed plan specifies that the 18 percent interest is to be paid on both the paid and unpaid balance—i.e., the total tax certificate price—despite periodic payments to the creditor reducing the principal balance over the life of the Chapter 13 plan."
"Does creditor's issuance of a post-petition summons and complaint in a state court action violate the automatic stay?","The Debtor filed a motion for contempt by Order to Show Cause against Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) and Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (“Nationstar”) alleging a violation of the automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1) and 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(3). The asserted violation arises from the issuance of a post-petition summons and complaint seeking a writ of assistance where the parties were notified of the bankruptcy filing. For the reasons set forth in this memorandum decision, the Court finds that a violation of the automatic stay did occur and awards damages."
"Is debtor entitled to damages in the event creditor issues a post-petition summons and complaint in a state court action?","Since the Court has already found, by Order dated December 15, 2009, that there is a willful violation of the stay, the award of actual damages is mandatory under Bankruptcy Code § 362(k)(1). The party moving for damages bears the burden of proof on damages. Sucre v. MIC Leasing Corp. (In re Sucre), 226 B.R. 340, 349 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1998)."
"Is the State liable for emotional distress damages and attorney fees due to willful violation of the automatic stay by continuing to garnish debtor's wages after the petition was filed?","Willful violations of the automatic stay occurred when DHHS and Harnett County failed to halt the garnishments of Debtor's Social Security benefits in the amount of $203.13 in July, 2015, and $278.38 in August, 2015, and when they failed to immediately correct these garnishments. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court will enter its Orders DENYING the Motion for Leave to Respond and Amended Motion to Respond, and enter its order: (1) finding that Harnett County and DHHS each committed willful violations of the automatic stay for which they are jointly and severally liable; (2) setting a further hearing to liquidate the amount of damages, including emotional damages, if any, caused to the Debtor by the violations set forth herein."
"Can the trustee avoid a motor vehicle lien under 11 U.S.C.S. § 547(b) if the lien was perfected under the applicable statutory codes?","While the amendments to the Idaho statutes could perhaps have been more precisely drafted, the Court concludes that the Legislature has determined that the date a properly completed application is received by the Department or its agent determines the perfection date for security interests in motor vehicles from and after July 1, 2007.11 As a result, the Court concludes Debtors and CAC have shown the requirements of § 547(c)(3) are satisfied in this case, and that Trustee can not avoid CAC's security interest in the Honda as a preference under § 547(b)."
"Are surviving beneficiary life insurance proceeds received by debtor within 180 days of filing property of the estate?","11 U.S.C. § 541 of the Bankruptcy Code lists the property that makes up a bankruptcy estate. Included in the list under § 541 it is stated that: (5) Any interest in property that would have been property of the estate if such interest had been an interest of the debtor on the date of the filing of the petition, and that the debtor acquires or becomes entitled to acquire within 180 days after such date— (C) as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy or of a death benefit plan. Based on § 541(a)(5)(C), the Trustee asserts that the $9,572.36 in proceeds Custis received from the insurance policy covering his deceased wife, should be turned over to him for the benefit of the estate. However, § 522(b) specifically excludes exempt property from being treated as property of the estate under § 541 (see Bancohio Nat. Bank v. Walters, 724 F.2d 1081 (4th Cir.1981)) and the debtor argues that he should be allowed to amend his homestead exemption available under § 34–4 of the Virginia Code to include $2,375 of the insurance proceeds, while also filing a new homestead exemption as a surviving spouse under § 64.1–151.3 of the Virginia Code for $5,000 of the insurance proceeds."
"In Tennessee, does bankruptcy protect a home from foreclosure?","The party applying for relief in such case shall distinctly state how, when, and to whom the debt or any part of the debt secured aforementioned has been paid, or any circumstances of fraud which vitiate the contract."
"Are patents protected from creditors in bankruptcy in Tennessee?","(b) (4) For purposes of paragraph (3)(C) and subsection (d)(12), the following shall apply:  (A) If the retirement funds are in a retirement fund that has received a favorable determination under section 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and that determination is in effect as of the date of the filing of the petition in a case under this title, those funds shall be presumed to be exempt from the estate. (B) If the retirement funds are in a retirement fund that has not received a favorable determination under such section 7805, those funds are exempt from the estate if the debtor demonstrates that—  (i) no prior determination to the contrary has been made by a court or the Internal Revenue Service; and (ii) (I) the retirement fund is in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or (II) the retirement fund fails to be in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the debtor is not materially responsible for that failure. (C) A direct transfer of retirement funds from 1 fund or account that is exempt from taxation under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, under section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or otherwise, shall not cease to qualify for exemption under paragraph (3)(C) or subsection (d)(12) by reason of such direct transfer. (D) (i) Any distribution that qualifies as an eligible rollover distribution within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or that is described in clause (ii) shall not cease to qualify for exemption under paragraph (3)(C) or subsection (d)(12) by reason of such distribution. (ii) A distribution described in this clause is an amount that—  (I) has been distributed from a fund or account that is exempt from taxation under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and (II) to the extent allowed by law, is deposited in such a fund or account not later than 60 days after the distribution of such amount."
"May a debtor assume and assign a joint venture agreement under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Second Circuit?","We are faced with a transaction cast as a sale/leaseback arrangement, a ""relatively modern, and clever, structure of financing which affords significant advantages to both purchaser-lessor and seller-lessee."" [Citation omitted]. Bernstein, acting for PCH, sought out Liona in order to pool their resources for their mutual benefit. The transaction was structured as a ground lease to accomplish a trade-off between tax benefits for PCH and a higher guaranteed return, without management concerns, for Liona. Therefore, rent was not calculated to compensate Liona for the use of the property; rather the parties structured the ""rent"" solely to ensure Liona's return on its investment. Furthermore, the ""purchase price"" paid by Liona for the land was not based on market rate, but was calculated as the amount necessary to finance the transaction.         It seems clear that no true lease was contemplated by the parties here. It is undisputed that Bernstein, acting for PCH, initiated the entire transaction, including the purchase of the land by Liona. [Citation Omitted] the court stated that the fact that property is ""purchased by the lessor specifically for the lessee's use"" tends to prove that no true lease exists. [Citation Omitted] (no true lease where lessee ""selected, inspected, contracted for, and received"" the property). [Citation Omitted] the court found no true lease where the ""lessee"" had originally requested a loan and the transaction was structured as a lease solely to secure tax advantages.         Another factor indicating that this transaction does not involve a true lease is that the purchase price was not related to the value of the land. A large inequality or discrepancy in values has been characterized as a ""strong circumstance"" tending to show that a transaction was a disguised financing scheme. Id. at 689; [Citation Omitted]. Furthermore, PCH assumed many of the obligations associated with outright ownership of the property, including responsibility for paying property taxes and insurance. As noted in the Senate Report on section 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code: [T]he fact that the lessee assumes and discharges substantially all the risks and obligations ordinarily attributed to the outright ownership of the property is more indicative of a financing transaction than of a true lease. The rental payments in such cases are in substance payments of principal and interest either on a loan secured by the leased real property or on the purchase of the leased real property. See, e.g., Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 13 and SEC Reg. S-X, 17 C.F.R. section 210.3-16(g) (1977); [Citation Omitted]         S.Rep. No. 598, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 64, reprinted in 1978 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 5787, 5850. Therefore, we find that PCH's significant indicia of ownership tend toward a finding that there is no true lease. Additionally, the provisions allowing Liona to recover its investment if the hotel were refinanced, and giving PCH the power to pre-pay Liona's investment, at which time Liona would share solely in profits, strongly suggest a transaction other than a lease."
"In Tennessee, does the automatic stay apply to actions to collect against surety bonds?","Because the property against which the Notice of Lien was filed is not property of the estate, nor is it property of the Debtor, and the lawsuit which Creditor seeks to file in state court is not in pursuit of a claim against the Debtor, rather it is a claim against property in which the Debtor has no interest, the automatic stay of §362 does not apply. It does not bar Creditor from filing the required lawsuit in state court to enforce its lien. To the extent that Creditor has a claim against a surety on a bond arising out of the debt owed by Debtor, the automatic stay does not apply to an action to collect solely on the bond."
"Is fraudulent misrepresentation considered a generalized claim that is property of the estate?","Several of the causes of action allege a direct injury to the debtor, from which an injury to the plaintiff school districts is derived.  For example, the plaintiffs school districts allege in paragraph XIII of the complaint that the defendants negligently managed EGHT, causing EGHT to become insolvent and thus unable to pay the claims of employees of the plaintiff school districts.  To the extent that this cause of action and others allege only a derivative harm to the plaintiff school districts, they belong exclusively to the estate.          We do agree, however, with the plaintiff school districts' contention that some of the causes of action allege a direct injury to themselves, which is not derivative of any harm to the debtor.  For example, the plaintiff school districts allege in paragraph XI of the complaint that the defendants intentionally misrepresented to them the financial situation of EGHT, and that they materially relied on such representations to their detriment.  To the extent that this cause of action and others allege a direct injury to the plaintiff school districts, they belong to the plaintiff school districts and not the estate.           In determining whether a cause of action may belong to the estate, the bankruptcy court focused on whether the act or omission complained of was directed specifically or generally at the school districts participating in EGHT.  Consequently, if the factfinder were to find that the act or omission was directed generally at the school districts participating in EGHT, then the cause of action would belong to the estate;  if not, then the cause of action would belong to the plaintiff school districts.  The problem with the bankruptcy court's framework is that it assumes, rather than decides, whether a cause of action belongs to the bankruptcy estate.  Stated differently, the fact that creditors in general are harmed does not determine whether a cause of action belongs to the bankruptcy estate;  rather, general harm to creditors necessarily follows from the fact that the debtor has been injured. The bankruptcy court's standard for determining whether a cause of action belongs to the estate ignores the relationship between the debtor and the nature of the injury suffered.  Because that relationship must be considered when determining whether a cause of action belongs to the estate, we conclude that the bankruptcy court applied the wrong legal standard to the causes of action listed in the complaint."
"Is the continued provision of insurance coverage considered subsequent new value under section 547(a)(2) and (c)(4)?","(c) The trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer— (4) to or for the benefit of a creditor, to the extent that, after such transfer, such creditor gave new value to or for the benefit of the debtor— (A) not secured by an otherwise unavoidable security interest; and (B) on account of which new value the debtor did not make an otherwise unavoidable transfer to or for the benefit of such creditor;"
"What is the standard for subordinating claims in the Southern District of New York?","In addition, “bankruptcy courts are empowered [by the common law concept of the equitable doctrine] to subordinate claims where the subordination will promote a just and equitable distribution of the bankruptcy estate.” Trone v. Smith (In re Westgate–California Corp.), 642 F.2d 1174, 1177 (9th Cir.1981) (citation omitted)."
"What happens to a lien lis pendens filed on a property held in bankruptcy estate in Tennessee?","Tennessee courts have ordered conveyance of land by specific performance in two situations. The first is where the seller breaches an enforceable land sale contract. [Citation Omitted]. On December 21, 1987, prior to the debtor's bankruptcy, Daniel filed a counter complaint against the debtor and his wife in federal district court. Daniel sought a court order of specific performance ordering the debtor and his wife to convey a one-half interest in the property to Daniel as agreed to in the Sales Agreement. However, before the court could issue such an order, the debtor filed bankruptcy. Had the court ordered the debtor to convey Daniel a one-half interest in the property prior to bankruptcy, this court would have been faced with a different set of issues. Since the debtor filed bankruptcy prior to any such court order, the debtor's legal interest in the property was never disturbed by operation of law. The second situation in which Tennessee courts have ordered a land conveyance by specific performance is where the seller is estopped from claiming that a land sale contract is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. [Citation Omitted]. These cases involve circumstances in which a buyer takes possession of real property pursuant to some agreement that later is found to violate the Statute of Frauds. In the agreement, the seller promises to execute and deliver a deed conveying the property to the buyer. In reliance on the agreement, the buyer takes possession of the property and improves it in some way. The seller then seeks to evict the buyer from the property on the grounds that the agreement violates the Statute of Frauds and is thus unenforceable. [Citation Omitted]. Applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel, Tennessee courts have held that the Statute of Frauds provisions should be mitigated under such circumstances and that the court should enforce the agreement by specific performance. [Citation Omitted].         The doctrine of equitable estoppel is not applicable in this case because the Sales Agreement was in every respect a valid and enforceable contract, as this court concluded in its December 19, 1990 judgement. Furthermore, as shown above, since the debtor filed bankruptcy prior to any court order under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the debtor's legal interest in the property remained undisturbed. After examining the various methods by which real property can be conveyed in Tennessee, the court concludes that the combination of factors cited by Daniel do not constitute the conveyance of an interest in real property. There is quite simply no precedent in Tennessee law under which a conveyance could have occurred under such circumstances. D. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that as of the date of his bankruptcy filing, none of the debtor's ownership interest in the 5154 Murfreesboro Road property was ever conveyed to Daniel. At all times prior to their divorce, debtor and his wife were full owners of the property. After the debtor's wife quitclaimed her one-half interest to the debtor pursuant to their divorce, the debtor retained a full, 100%, undivided ownership interest in the property. This ownership constituted a ""legal interest"" in all of the property under 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). Consequently, 100% of the Murfreesboro Road property became property of the bankruptcy estate upon filing. All net proceeds generated from the sale of the property also should be property of the bankruptcy estate. Accordingly, the court concludes that the trustee may retain all of the net sale proceeds generated by the sale of the property. Such proceeds are currently held by the trustee pursuant to the March 21, 1991 Order, which paid all proceeds held in escrow to the trustee pending resolution of this complaint."
"Will a court dismiss a case under section 1112(b) where there is a two-party dispute?","Because I conclude that a confirmable plan is not possible in this case and that there is no reorganization in progress but rather that a two party dispute persists which is not and need not be addressed in the bankruptcy forum, I find ""cause"" to dismiss this case. Since Ram has only one asset which is fully encumbered, there is no estate for a Chapter 7 trustee to administer. Thus, dismissal as opposed to conversion is indicated. Under new § 1112 when cause is found, the court shall dismiss or convert unless special circumstances exist that establish that the requested conversion or dismissal is not in the best interests of creditors and the estate. 11 U.S.C. § 1112(b)(1). Except for the partially secured claim of the Department of Revenue, the movant Old Gold which seeks dismissal is the only creditor in this case. I find no unusual circumstances that suggest dismissal is not in the best interests of the other creditor and the estate. Moreover, for the reasons discussed above, it follows that the debtor has not established that a plan can be confirmed at all, let alone within the deadlines of § 1121(e) and 1129(e) or within a reasonable time when those deadlines do not apply. 11 U.S.C. § 1112(b)(2)."
"What effect does rejection of an executory contract by a debtor have on a guarantor?","We start with the basic principle that the Bankruptcy Code in this country was designed to benefit and protect debtors who sought relief under its provisions. One such provision, 11 U.S.C. § 502(b)(6), sets a limitation on a landlord's claim against a bankrupt-lessee's obligation under a lease of real property. This limitation, or cap, comes into play once the bankruptcy trustee rejects the lease under 11 U.S.C. § 365(a).  The defendants argue that this cap, or limitation on liability, ought also limit the liability of third party guarantors of the rejected lease. However, this position contravenes both the express and implied goals of the Bankruptcy Code, thus this Court rejects it. The Bankruptcy Code specifically states in 11 U.S.C. § 524(e) that ""discharge of a debt of the debtor does not affect the liability of any other entity on, or the property of any other entity for, such debt."" This section has been cited in a number of cases which hold that a guarantor's liability remains even after the bankrupt principal is released from liability. [Citation Omitted]. In one such case, [Citation Omitted], debtor's plan of reorganization limited his obligation to one creditor to 30% of the total debt. The court permitted the creditor to seek the balance of the obligation from the guarantor even though the debtor was discharged from liability for the balance. Similarly, the guarantors in the case at bar are liable for the balance of the rent owed to the landlord, Bel-Ken, despite the fact that BFS is not. Maryland law on guaranty contracts supports the conclusion that the guarantors of a lease are liable even when the principal debtor is discharged in bankruptcy. A contract of guaranty is collateral to and independent of the principal contract that is guaranteed and, as a result, the guarantor is not a party to the principal obligation. A guarantor is therefore secondarily liable to the creditor on his contract and his promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another becomes absolute upon default of the principal debtor and the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to liability . . . As such, the guarantor insures the ability or solvency of the principal.[Citation Omitted]. Finally, common sense dictates that the guarantor remain fully liable even when the principal debtor seeks relief under the Bankruptcy Code. After all, what good is a guaranteed lease if the guarantor escapes liability when the debtor does? Certainly, a guarantor's liability may be limited to prevent a landlord from recovering ""disproportionately large claims,"" [Citation Omitted] (debtor merged with guarantor prior to bankruptcy; landlord-creditor attempted to collect damages on breach of contract and breach of guaranty claims). However, the guarantor's liability is not limited merely because the debtor's liability is reduced by the trustee in bankruptcy."
"Can you collect contractual attorneys fees for post petition work on a general unsecured claim?","The Debtor's reading of § 502(b) follows the reasoning that what is not allowed by the Bankruptcy Code is expressly prohibited. See [Citation omitted] (explaining the only section of the Bankruptcy Code that expressly authorizes payment of attorneys' fees as part of a claim is § 506(b)). Under this logic, the Debtor argues, that because the allowance of attorney's fees on an unsecured claim is not expressly allowed pursuant to § 502(b), it must then be disallowed. The Court is not prepared to adopt such a narrow reading of § 502(b). As noted in [Citation omitted], the Court “generally presume[s] that claims enforceable under applicable state law will be allowed in bankruptcy unless they are expressly disallowed.” [Citation omitted] (emphasis added). Section 502(b)(1) disallows a claim to the extent the claim is “unenforceable against the debtor ... under any agreement or applicable law for a reason other than because such claim is contingent or unmatured.” 11 U.S.C. § 502(b)(1). The Debtor presented no evidence to suggest the contract for attorney's fees is unenforceable other than because the underlying claims are unsecured. [Citation omitted] (“the Bankruptcy Code does not bar an unsecured claim for post-petition attorneys' fees authorized by a prepetition contract valid under state law”). The purpose of § 502 is to allow or disallow claims. No provision under § 502 expressly disallows attorney's fees on unsecured claims. The purpose of § 506 is to determine what amounts may be recovered from the value of the collateral, not to determine the validity of a claim. Therefore, finding no objection to the validity of the attorney's fees and that neither § 502(b) nor any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code expressly disallow attorney's fees in conjunction with an unsecured claim, the objections to SSB's claims are OVERRULED. SSB is entitled to an unsecured claim for post-petition attorney's fees in the amount of $36,859.90 on account of Claim Nos. 10 and 11."
"Under what conditions can a trustee abandon property in Texas?","(a) After notice and a hearing, the trustee may abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate."
"Who is qualified to serve on a creditors committee under bankruptcy code Section 1102?","The requirements to qualify for the Unsecured Creditors' Committee are essentially three: ""1) one must be a creditor; 2) one must hold a claim; and 3) the claim held must be unsecured."" [Citation omitted]."
"Is a tax claim nondischargeable where the filing extension brought the due date within three years of the petition date?","Debtor's 2009 tax liability, however, is nondischargeable. Debtor's 2009 tax return, after he requested an extension, was due on October 15, 2010. Therefore, in order to have the 2009 tax claim fall outside the ""three year rule,"" Debtor would have needed to file for bankruptcy after October 15, 2013. Debtor filed for bankruptcy on February 15, 2013—eight months too early. Therefore, the 2009 tax liability qualifies is a priority claim under 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(8)(A)(i) and is nondischargeable under § 523(a)(1)(A). Debtor concedes that under the language of the Code, his 2009 tax liability is nondischargeable, but asks that the Court discharge the liability based on hardship. However, HN2there is no hardship exception for taxes under the Bankruptcy Code. See § 523; In re Maali, 432 B.R. 348, 353 & 353 n.5 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2010) (""The bankruptcy court, however, had no authority to consider hardship as a basis to discharge [debtor's] tax obligations. . . . [T]here is no statutory 'hardship' test for determining whether certain tax liabilities are excepted from discharge under § 523(a)(1)""); In re Moore, 214 B.R. 887, 890 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1997) (""The Bankruptcy Code expressly provides for the priority and nondischargeability of these federal income taxes, and creates no exception in the chapter 7 context for hardship or any other equitable grounds.""). The three-year nondischargeability rule is mandatory and the Court has no authority to discharge Debtor's 2009 tax liability, even with proof of Debtor's hardship."
"If debtor claims the homestead exemption, does this nullify the trustee's ability to propose a sale of debtor's residence subject to an undersecured mortgage lien where proceeds are subject to the claimed exemption?","As required by the Bankruptcy Code and applicable case law, the Trustee has given his reasoning for the proposed sale. Under his analysis, the Debtor's estate stands to gain $20,000.00 from the sale of the Premises. Therefore, the sale would result in a substantial benefit to the unsecured creditors of the Debtor. If this were true, the Court would grant the Motion as the Trustee would have satisfied his statutory burden. However, the Debtor has claimed a homestead exemption pursuant to the N.Y. CPLR in the amount of $150,000.00. If the Debtor is entitled to payment for his claimed homestead exemption, the Trustee's proffered justification for the sale would cease to exist as the sale would generate no benefit to the creditors."
"Can a bankruptcy court use statistical sampling to allow a disputed claim against the estate?","The district court allowed the use of a statistical sample of the class claims in determining compensatory damages. In all, 10,059 claims were received. The district court ruled 518 of these claims to be facially invalid, leaving 9,541 claims. From these, a list of 137 claims was randomly selected by computer. This number of randomly selected claims was chosen on the basis of the testimony of James Dannemiller, an expert on statistics, who testified that the examination of a random sample of 137 claims would achieve a 95 percent statistical probability that the same percentage determined to be valid among the examined claims would be applicable to the totality of claims filed. Of the claims selected, 67 were for torture, 52 were for summary execution, and 18 were for disappearance."
"Are you less likely to have your student debt discharged, the more advanced degrees you have?","ISAC argues that Strand's pattern of going back to school for additional advanced degrees demonstrates his disregard for the loan obligations and a lack of good faith in repayment of the loans. Moreover, ISAC claims, his earning advanced degrees is not consistent with his purported learning disabilities and psychological problems. The Court disagrees. Strand kept going back to school precisely because he believed it to be the best route to reliable future financial resources. Unfortunately, his dyslexia made formal education more difficult for him and so, although he completed some of the programs in which he enrolled, his academic performance was poor. His psychological problems, and his growing physical medical problems, made the employment he did obtain contentious and short-lived."
"Is a third party who purchased the assets of a Chapter 11 debtor entitled to an order enjoining one of debtor's former employees for filing suit in federal court?","We are sensitive to the concerns raised in Forde. We recognize that the claims of the EEOC and the Knox-Schillinger class of plaintiffs are based on congressional enactments addressing employment discrimination and are, therefore, not to be extinguished absent a compelling justification. At the same time, in the context of a bankruptcy, these claims are, by their nature, general unsecured claims and, as such, are accorded low priority. To allow the claimants to assert successor liability claims against American while limiting other creditors' recourse to the proceeds of the asset sale would be inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Code's priority scheme."
"Does a party who failed to file a proof of claim have standing to prosecute actions on behalf of the bankruptcy estate?","In sum, this Court concludes that “particularly extraordinary circumstances” exist for an individual entity to gain standing to sue on behalf of the Chapter 11 estate when all of the following conditions are present: (1) no creditors' committee has been formed; (2) the entity seeking standing to sue holds an undisputed claim or interest or, if disputed, has filed a proof of claim or proof of interest that has not been disallowed; (3) the entity seeking standing to sue is itself in complete compliance with the Code and the Rules and does not otherwise have “unclean hands,” see generally Asarco LLC v. Ams. Mining Corp., 396 B.R. 278, 333 (S.D.Tex.2008) (the “unclean hands” doctrine provides that a litigant who engages in reprehensible conduct in relation to a matter in controversy forfeits his right to have the court hear his claim, regardless of its merits); and (4) all of the requirements set forth in Louisiana World Exposition are satisfied. With respect to Hepford, the Court finds that he cannot satisfy the “particularly extraordinary circumstances” test because he has filed neither a proof of claim nor a proof of interest; and thus, he “shall not be treated as a creditor with respect to such claim for the purposes of voting and distribution.” Fed. R. Bankr.P. 3003(c)(2). Affording someone, who is neither a creditor nor an equity security holder, the opportunity to prosecute a cause of action on behalf of the estate is unjustifiable: only those who are stakeholders should be allowed to participate in the bankruptcy process. See e.g., Motor Vehicle Cas. Co. v. Thorpe Insulation Co . (In re Thorpe Insulation Co.), 677 F.3d 869, 887 (9th Cir.2012) (“As applied in the Chapter 11 context, Article III standing exists where ‘the participant holds a financial stake in the outcome of the proceeding such that the participant has an appropriate incentive to participate in an adversarial form to protect his or her interests.’ ”) (citations omitted)."
"Do the creditor's rights under a purchase agreement with debtor for purchase of shares in debtor's subsidiary form the basis for a proof of claim?","Code § 101(5)(B) defines “claim” to include a “right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment.” Where the same breach gives the aggrieved party the alternative of an equitable remedy or money damages, the resulting right is a “claim.” In re Ben Franklin Hotel, Assocs., 186 F.3d 301, 305 (3d Cir.1999) (“[A]n equitable remedy will ‘give rise to a right of payment,’ and therefore be deemed a ‘claim,’ when the payment of monetary damages is an alternative to the equitable remedy.”); In re Udell, 18 F.3d 403, 408 (7th Cir.1994) (“[A] right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance is a ‘claim’ if the same breach also gives rise to a right to a payment ‘with respect to’ the equitable remedy. If the right to payment is an ‘alternative’ to the right to an equitable remedy, the necessary relationship clearly exists, for the two remedies would be substitutes for one another.”) (footnote omitted); United States v. LTV Corp. (In re Chateaugay Corp.), 944 F.2d 997, 1008 (2d Cir.1991) (“An injunction that does no more than impose an obligation entirely as an alternative to a payment right is dischargeable.”); 2 ALAN N. RESNICK & HENRY J. SOMMER, COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY ¶ 101.05[5], at 101–47 (16th ed. 2010) (“COLLIER”) (If a judgment for specific performance can be satisfied by an alternative right to payment in the event performance is refused, the creditor entitled to specific performance has a “claim” under the Bankruptcy Code.); see United States v. Apex Oil Co., 579 F.3d 734, 736 (7th Cir.2009) (“The natural reading of [11 U.S.C. § 101(5)(B) ] is that if the holder of an equitable claim can, in the event that the equitable remedy turns out to be unobtainable, obtain a money judgment instead, the claim is dischargeable.”), cert. denied, ––– U.S. ––––, 131 S.Ct. 67, 178 L.Ed.2d 23 (2010). Conversely, where a creditor does not have the option to accept money in lieu of the equitable remedy, the equitable obligation is not a “claim” and is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. 2 Collier ¶ 101.05[5], at 101–47 to 101–48 (“[R]ights to an equitable remedy for breach of performance with respect to which such breach does not give rise to a right to payment are not ‘claims' within the Code's contemplation, and would not therefore be dischargeable in bankruptcy, unless such obligations could be translated into a claim for damages if breached.”); see Apex Oil, 579 F.3d at 737 (“[T]he government's equitable claim ... entitles the government only to require the defendant to clean up the contaminated site at the defendant's expense.... The plaintiff in our case (the government) is not seeking a payment of money and the injunction that it has obtained does not entitle it to payment.”)."
"Is a subsidized public housing lease considered a ""similar grant"" under 11 U.S.C.S. § 525(a) because the property was unobtainable from the private sector and essential to debtor's fresh start?","We find that Smith's 2010 Lease may not be considered a “grant” under 11 U.S.C. § 525(a). The Court agrees with and chooses to follow the reasoning in Watts and finds that a lease does not have the same qualities as the other listed protected rights and, therefore, cannot be considered an “other similar grant” under the Statute. We also believe that had Congress intended a lease to be considered in the Statute it would have explicitly included leases in the language but it did not. We cannot speculate that Congress intended leases to be considered under Section 525 simply based on the “fresh start” analysis. Taking into account the legislative history noted in Smith's Brief, we realize that Congress did intend for a debtor to have a “fresh start,” however, we don't believe that Congress intended that fresh start to be at the expense of the rights of the lease holder, HACP, or at the expense of the rights of the other low-income candidates who qualify for public housing. Furthermore, we believe that a fresh start can be obtained by the debtor through the mechanisms put into place by way of the bankruptcy proceedings. Finding that a lease is not a grant we may terminate our analysis here and find that HACP is not acting in a discriminatory fashion when proceeding in the eviction of Smith. However, we will continue our analysis to cover the third element of the law."
"If real estate is owned by a trust where debtor is trustee, is said real estate property of the estate and subject to the homestead exemption?","Based upon the undisputed evidence in this case, the Court concludes that the Debtor, in her capacity as Trustee, granted herself rightful possession of the property and intended to occupy it as her principal residence. She did not need to execute a lease with herself to authorize rightful possession. Although the Debtor may not have successfully revoked the Trust, the record contains evidence in the form of the Declaration of Homestead and Schedule A that she viewed the property as her home and intended to occupy it as such. In view of the decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court in Shamban v. Masidlover, 429 Mass. 50, 705 N.E.2d 1136 (1999), and Dwyer v. Cempellin, 424 Mass. 26, 673 N.E.2d 863, 867 (1996), this Court finds and predicts that the Supreme Judicial Court also would find that the Debtor rightfully possessed the property through a grant of occupancy to herself and validly claimed a homestead under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, § 1. The Trustee's Objection is predicated upon an invalid homestead. The Court finds that the Debtor has a valid homestead under Massachusetts law. The question left unanswered is whether the real property is property of the estate. Whether it is, or is not, and whether the Debtor can claim the property as exempt from property of the estate under 11 U.S.C. § 522(b), is not determinative. Even were the parties to obtain a determination that the property is property of the estate, because this Court has determined that the Debtor has a valid homestead she could claim the property as exempt. In other words, even were the Trustee to file and adversary proceeding and obtain a determination as to the status of the property as property of the estate, and proceeds from a sale of the property after satisfaction of valid liens and encumbrances would inure to the benefit of the Debtor, not the unsecured creditors."
"Can subsequent transferees, who were not named in a judgment avoiding an initial transfer, require the trustee in a subsequent recovery proceeding to re-establish the avoidability of the transfer?","Under chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code, avoidance and recovery are separate remedies available to a bankruptcy trustee, found in separate sections, with different purposes, discrete elements of proof, and distinct limitation periods. The present motion for partial summary judgment puts the distinction between avoidance and recovery to the test. To resolve it, the court must decide whether subsequent transferees who were not named in the judgment avoiding the initial transfer, may require the trustee in a later § 550 recovery proceeding to re-prove the avoidability of the transfer."
"Is a bad faith dismissal of the bankruptcy case warranted where debtor fails to make full disclosure of his assets and financial affairs?","Prior to the amendments to the Bankruptcy Code in 2005, the Circuits were split on whether a standard such as bad faith can serve as “cause” for dismissal under § 707(a). Compare Industrial Insurance Services, Inc. v. Zick (In re Zick), 931 F.2d 1124, 1126–27 (6th Cir.1991) (finding lack of good faith as an implicit jurisdictional requirement and thus grounds for dismissal under § 707(a)); with In re Padilla, 222 F.3d 1184, 1191 (9th Cir.2000) (finding § 707(a) reserved for technical violations of the Code). The Second Circuit did not rule on the issue, but courts in this Circuit frequently followed Zick in dismissing cases under § 707(a) where there is an absence of good faith. Dinova v. Harris (In re Dinova), 212 B.R. 437, 442 (2d Cir.BAP1997), citing H.R.Rep. No. 95–595, at 380 (1977), held that courts must engage in a case-by-case analysis to determine if dismissal is in the “best interest of all parties.” Dinova, 212 B.R. at 442. The party moving for dismissal bears the burden of proving cause by a preponderance of the evidence, and court also exercises substantial discretion in determining a motion to dismiss under § 707(a). In re Aiello, 428 B.R. 296, 299 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.2010). See also In re Lombardo, 370 B.R. 506, 511 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.2007); In re Griffieth, 209 B.R. 823, 827–28 (Bankr.N.D.N.Y.1996). Courts considered a variety of factors in assessing good faith under § 707(a). In re Grifieth, 209 B.R. at 827 (laying out a six factor test); In re Keobapha, 279 B.R. 49, 53 (Bankr.D.Conn.2002) (laying out a fourteen factor test); In re Lombardo, 370 B.R. at 512–13 (adopting the Griffieth test while also using nine of the Keobapha factors). There is a further question whether the cases survived the 2005 Amendments, as the adoption in 2005 of a specific “filed in bad faith” standard in § 707(b) supports the proposition that bad faith cannot serve as a cause for dismissal under § 707(a). Marianne B. Culhane and Michaela M. White, Catching Can–Pay Debtors: Is the Means Test the Only Way?, 13 Am. Bankr.Inst. L.Rev. 665, 683, n. 89 (2005), citing In re Padilla, 222 F.3d at 1191. In any event, this issue need not be reached; even assuming that there is continuing judicial discretion to dismiss for lack of good faith under § 707(a), the Debtors did not act in bad faith. The Armstrong factors discussed above compel this conclusion. The same result obtains under the fifteen factor approach in Lombardo, which is the most commonly and recently utilized § 707(a) test. See also In re Parikh, 456 B.R. 4, 20–21 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.2011); In re Aiello, 428 B.R. at 302; In re Mazzella, No. 09–78449,2010 WL 5058395, at *5–6 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.2010). Indeed, there is general consensus that the standard for finding bad faith under § 707(a) is stringent, and “is generally utilized only in those egregious cases that entail concealed or misrepresented assets and/or sources of income, and excessive and continued expenditures, lavish lifestyle, and intention to avoid a large single debt based on conduct akin to fraud, misconduct, or gross negligence.” In re Zick, 931 F.2d at 1129 (emphasis added)."
"Can the bankruptcy court assert jurisdiction over a state law action by debtor against a party who sold debtor a manufactured home and real estate?","Marcia L. Pate (hereinafter “Debtor”) brings this adversary proceeding against Melvin Williams Manufactured Homes, Inc. and Greentree Financial Corporation (hereinafter “Greentree”) asserting state law claims for violation of the Uniform Commercial Code—Sales as adopted in Georgia, Georgia Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act and fraud and for violation of the Federal Truth in Lending Act arising out of the Debtor's purchase and financing of a mobile home from the Defendants. The Defendants answered the complaint and Defendant Greentree filed a motion to stay the adversary proceeding and to compel the Debtor to submit the claims to arbitration according to the terms of the sales contract. The motion is granted. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b) and 28 U.S.C. § 157(a), (b)(1)(2)(C) & (O)3. The claims asserted by the Debtor are core proceedings. Chrysler Credit Corp. v. Ferris (In re Ferris), 42 B.R. 374 (S.D.Ga.1984) reversed on other grounds 764 F.2d 1475 (11th Cir.1984). (Bankruptcy Courts have jurisdiction to decide a Truth in Lending Act claim against a secured creditor that has filed a claim in the bankruptcy case. Paragraph (d)(3)(A) of the Emergency Resolution promulgated December 24, 1982 authorizes bankruptcy courts to hear matters necessary to the administration of bankruptcy cases which included “... counterclaims by the estate in whatever amount against persons filing claims against the estate.” Compare, 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(C) at note 3.) Defendant Greentree filed a secured claim in the amount of $38,996.19 in the Debtor's Chapter 13 case. Additionally, the claims asserted by the Debtor against both Defendants arose before the bankruptcy filing, constitute assets of the estate, and this adversary proceeding therefore affects the liquidation of estate assets."
"Does a bankruptcy court have the discretion to abstain from hearing a fraudulent transfer proceeding based solely on state law?","Section 1334(c)(1), as contained in Title 28 of the United States Code, confers upon this Court the power to exercise its discretion and abstain from hearing certain matters. In relevant part, this provision provides: Nothing ... prevents a district court in the interest of justice, or in the interest of comity with State courts or respect for State law, from abstaining from hearing a particular proceeding arising under title 11 or arising in or related to a case under title 11. Relying on this grant of authority, this Court previously abstained from hearing two matters, see discussion supra, in the Debtor's bankruptcy case. In large measure, the rationale underlying both of these decisions to abstain rested on the same basis: closely related matters were already pending in the state-court receivership action. It is now under this same rationale,—the pendency of litigation in state court regarding the avoidability of those transfers which the Trustee now seeks to recover in this proceeding—on which the Defendant bases its Motion to Abstain."
"Can you extend 365(e) to a contract where the debtor is not a party?","The State contends that it would be deprived of protections under § 365(d)(2) if Debtor's motion to assume and assign its lease is granted. Section 365(d)(2) provides: In a case under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13 of this title, the trustee may assume or reject an executory contract or unexpired lease of residential real property or of personal property of the debtor at any time before the confirmation of a plan but the court, on request of any party to such contract or lease, may order the trustee to determine within a specified period of time whether to assume or reject such contract or lease. 11 U.S.C. § 365(d)(2) (emphasis added)."
"In a Chapter 11 proceeding, are allegedly fraudulent pre-petition transfers by debtor to an electric utility subject to the reasonably equivalent value defense to avoidance?","A fraudulent transfer occurs when (1) a debtor was insolvent on the date that the transfer was made or became insolvent as a result of the transfer; (2) the debtor received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer; and (3) the transfer was made on or within two years before the date the debtor filed the petition for bankruptcy. See 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(1). The parties do not dispute on appeal whether the 2006 Transfer was made within two years of the petition filing or whether Northlake was insolvent on the date of the transfer or became insolvent as a result of the transfer. The only question before us is whether the District Court erred when it ruled that Northlake's S-corporation election constituted reasonably equivalent value for the 2006 Transfer. “The purpose of voiding transfers unsupported by reasonably equivalent value is to protect creditors against the depletion of a bankrupt's estate. Therefore, this provision does not authorize voiding a transfer which confers an economic benefit upon the debtor.” In re Rodriguez, 895 F.2d 725, 727 (11th Cir.1990) (internal marks and citations omitted). Where an economic benefit is present, “the debtor's net worth has been preserved, and the interests of the creditors will not have been injured by the transfer.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The complaint clearly shows that the Shareholders Agreement provides Northlake with valuable benefits by virtue of its S-corporation election. We hold that these benefits constitute a reasonably equivalent exchange of value for the 2006 Transfer and therefore affirm."
"Should the court confirm Chapter 13 debtor's three-year plan if he deducts ordinary and necessary business expenses when calculating current monthly income to determine the length of the plan?","The issue presented to the Court involves the calculation of Debtor's current monthly income to determine the applicable commitment period required for a Chapter 13 plan. The Debtor is a self-employed subcontracted truck driver who necessarily incurs business expenses related to the services he provides. The Debtor has deducted business expenses from his self-employed income which resulted in below-median income, entitling the Debtor to file a plan with only a three (3) year commitment period. The Trustee contests deduction of ordinary and necessary business expenses when calculating Debtor's current monthly income to determine the applicable commitment period and insists that, without said deductions, the Debtor is required to file a plan with a five (5) year commitment period."
"Will a department of correction's attempts to collect electronic monitoring, housing maintenance and intervention fees violate the automatic stay?","Under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(7) the debt cannot be imposed as compensation for actual pecuniary loss. Kelly, 479 U.S. at 51, 107 S.Ct. 353. The parties concede that determination of this issue is closely tied to the determination of whether the Incarceration Costs constitute a fine or penalty. In re Miller, 511 B.R. at 631 (finding no cases in which a debt was determined to be both penal and compensatory, or both non-penal and non-compensatory)."
"Are debtor's prepetition payments made pursuant to a Ponzi scheme avoidable as fraudulent transfers?","Before the Court is the motion to dismiss filed by Novator Credit Management Limited, Novator Credit Advisors LLC, Novator Credit Opportunities Master Fund, Novator Credit Luxembourg SARL, Novator Credit Funding B.V., Novator Credit Opportunities Fund, Novator Credit Opportunities Fund LLC, and Novator Partners LLP (collectively, “Novator” or the “Defendants”), asserting that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (“Rule”) 12(b)(6), made applicable herein by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure (“Bankruptcy Rule”) 7012 (the “Motion to Dismiss”). Pursuant to the avoidance provisions of §§ 544, 547, 548(a), 550 of the Bankruptcy Code (the “Code”) and various sections of New York Debtor and Creditor Law (the “NYDCL”), the chapter 11 trustee, Sheila Gowan (“Gowan” or the “Trustee”) seeks to avoid and recover prepetition transfers by Dreier LLP (the “Debtor”) to the Defendants in the course of the Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Marc Dreier. In total, the Trustee seeks the avoidance and recovery of $16,801,025 from the Defendants to the Dreier LLP estate for distribution to creditors. The Trustee concedes that Novator was a “net loser” in the Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Marc Dreier because Novator received transfers less than the $30 million purported loan Novator made to Solow during the course of the Note fraud."
"Is debtor's failure to disclose sources of income tantamount to a false oath on a material matter and therefore grounds for denial of discharge?","Section 727(a)(4)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code provides “the Court shall grant a debtor a discharge unless ... the debtor knowingly and fraudulently, in or in connection with the case ... made a false oath or account.” The elements of § 727(a)(4)(A) are: (1) the debtor made a statement under oath; (2) the statement was false; (3) the debtor knew the statement was false; (4) the debtor made the statement with fraudulent intent; and (5) the statement related materially to the bankruptcy case. Keeney v. Smith (In re Keeney), 227 F.3d 679, 685 (6th Cir.2000). Whether the debtor has made a false oath under § 727(a)(4)(A) is a question of fact. In re Ward, C/A No. 11–04760–DD, 2012 WL 3201871, at *9 (Bankr.D.S.C. Aug. 2, 2012) (citing Williamson v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 828 F.2d 249, 251 (4th Cir.1987)). “A fundamental purpose of § 727(a)(4)(A) is to ensure that dependable information is supplied for those interested in the administration of the bankruptcy estate on which they can rely without the need for the trustee or other interested parties to dig out the true facts in examinations or investigations.” In re Haverland, 150 B.R. 768, 770 (Bankr.S.D.Cal.1993) (internal quotations omitted). The evidence indicates that elements (1), (2), and (3) are clearly met. Pursuant to the Court's Order on Summary Judgment, the only remaining consideration is whether Haynes made the false statements with fraudulent intent and whether the statements related materially to the bankruptcy case. The Court finds that the UST has met its burden of proof on these remaining issues and denial of Haynes' discharge pursuant to § 727(a)(4)(A) is warranted."
"Should retroactive relief from stay be granted to creditor in order to affirm and ratify a foreclosure sale conducted after debtor filed his third bankruptcy petition?","Debtor does not dispute Movant's suggestion that it had neither notice nor knowledge of the filing of the second case at the time the sale was conducted. 2. Debtor's Lack Of Good Faith Debtor's conduct, both in this case and the prior two Chapter 13 filings, evidences a lack of good faith. Each of Debtor's prior cases was filed on the eve of a foreclosure sale and for the specific purpose of preventing those sales and frustrating Movant's attempt to enforce its right of foreclosure. There was no evidence presented that the Debtor had an intent in any of the three cases to obtain a discharge through a confirmed and/or consummated plan."
"Should the court grant trustee's objection to debtor's state homestead exemption based on uncodified language of  Ohio Sub. H.B. 479, § 3 regarding the effective date?","Ohio case law pertaining to prior changes in exemption law also supports the position. See, e.g., In re Jaber, 406 B.R. 756; In re Lude, 291 B.R. 109 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 2003); In re Marinski, 9 B.R. 579. Because the Current Homestead is a relatively new topic in Ohio bankruptcy law, the court was able to locate only one case analyzing the applicability of the Current Homestead. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Ohio in In re Depascale, 496 B.R. 860, ultimately concluded that the Current Homestead should be applied as of the petition date. In analyzing the issue, the court first noted that courts in Ohio have consistently applied bankruptcy exemptions in effect as of the petition date to debts that accrued before the petition date. Id. at 867–68. The court then moved to an analysis of the relevant statutes, noting that both §§ 522(b)(3)(A) and O.R.C. 2329.66(D)(1) suggest that the petition date should be used to determine the available exemptions. Id. at 869. Therefore, based on case history and statutory guidance, the court “[did] not see any impediment to applying the [Current Homestead] amount to bankruptcy cases filed on or after the effective date of H .B. 479.” Id. at 868. The court then moved to an analysis of House Bill 479, noting that while Section 3 may appear to be inconsistent with the court's holding, Section 3 is uncodified law that conflicts with the plain language of O.R.C. § 2329.66, is internally nonsensical, and is therefore inapplicable. See id. at 869–71. The court agrees with the reasoning of In re Depascale. 496 B.R. at 867–68. The plain language of §§ 522(b)(3)(A) and O.R.C. 2329.66(D)(1), bankruptcy policy, and case law support the position that exemptions should be determined as of the petition date. However, Section 3 of House Bill 479 states that “[t]he amendments made by [the Current Homestead] shall apply to claims accruing on or after the effective date of this act.” If the court assumes that Section 3 is applicable, which is the opposite of the decision in In re Depascale, the Code's requirement that exemptions should be determined as of the petition date would conflict with Section 3. The court must determine which law to apply: federal or state."
"On what grounds can debtor force the trustee to accept his opinions regarding how the sale and liquidation of his former assets should be conducted?","The term “cooperate” is broad, and requires that whenever the trustee calls upon the debtor for assistance in performance of the trustee's duties, the debtor is required to respond, at least if the request is not unreasonable. In re Morey, 416 B.R. 364 (Bankr.D.Mass.2009), citing In re Stinson, 221 B.R. 726 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.1998)."
"Is a bankruptcy appellate panel's order rejecting debtor's proposed plan a final appealable order where the underlying action came to the court under 28 U.S.C.S. § 158(d)(1)?","Because this appeal comes to us under § 158(d)(1), we have jurisdiction only if the BAP's order rejecting Bullard's proposed plan is a final order.3 We have noted that an order of the BAP cannot be final unless the underlying bankruptcy court order is final. Watson v. Boyajian (In re Watson), 403 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005). “[B]ecause bankruptcy cases typically involve numerous controversies bearing only a slight relationship to each other, ‘finality’ is given a flexible interpretation in bankruptcy.” Bourne v. Northwood Props., LLC (In re Northwood Props., LLC), 509 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). This flexibility means that an order may be final even if it does not resolve all issues in the case, “but it must finally dispose of all the issues pertaining to a discrete dispute within the larger proceeding.” Perry v. First Citizens Fed. Credit Union (In re Perry), 391 F.3d 282, 285 (1st Cir.2004). We have recognized that, when an intermediate appellate court “remands a matter to the bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings, there is no final order for purposes of § 158(d) and the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction.” In re Gould & Eberhardt Gear Mach. Corp., 852 F.2d 26, 29 (1st Cir.1988). Conversely, “[w]hen a remand leaves only ministerial proceedings, for example, computation of amounts according to established formulae, then the remand may be considered final.” Id."
"Is a debtor church in Chapter 11 entitled to prohibit the mortgage holder from credit bidding at its sale of property under 11 U.S.C.S. § 363(k)?","I agree with the United States Trustee that the standard here is the existence or not of “cause,” and that the existence of a bona fide dispute as to the secured claim is not necessarily cause. In many cases, the existence of a bona fide dispute as to the secured claim is cause. Here, however, I conclude that the counterclaims do not amount to cause to prohibit credit bidding."
"Is there sufficient cause to dismiss debtor's third Chapter 11 case filed within 18 months under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1112(b)?","Section 1112(b)(1) requires the court to convert or dismiss a chapter 11 proceeding upon a showing of cause. “The bankruptcy court has broad discretion to determine what constitutes ‘cause’ under § 1112(b).” The moving party “bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that cause exists.” 3While the term “cause” is not specifically defined, § 1112(b)(4) provides a non-exclusive list of factors considered cause for conversion or dismissal. In this instance, the movants rely on the following subsections of § 1112(b)(4) to find cause: substantial or continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation, under subsection (b)(4)(A); the debtor's unauthorized use of cash collateral substantially harmful to one or more creditors under subsection (b)(4)(D); and the debtor's unexcused failure to timely satisfy any filing or reporting requirements under subsection (b)(4)(F). DSB also asserts bad faith on the debtor's part as a basis for dismissal. Although bad faith is not listed as a ground to find cause under § 1112(b)(4), it is a well recognized basis for conversion or dismissal under § 1112(b)(2). Upon a finding of cause, the court is required to dismiss or convert the case, whichever is in the best interests of the creditors and the estate, unless it “finds and specifically identifies unusual circumstances establishing that converting or dismissing the case is not in the best interests of creditors and the estate.” Even then, to avoid conversion or dismissal, the debtor must prove that there is a reasonable likelihood that a plan will be confirmed within a reasonable time, and that it has a reasonable justification for, and can cure within a reasonable time, any act or omission that constitutes a basis for conversion or dismissal."
"Does the bankruptcy court have authority to void a state court judgment due to preceding alleged violation of automatic stay by the state court while debtor's bankruptcy was pending?","This is Debtor's third bankruptcy case filed in three years. The first two were dismissed without a discharge for Debtor. Throughout her three cases, certain litigation in New York has proceeded and has been, on occasion, stayed by her filings. The dispute before me now revolves about the entry of a judgment against her in 2013 in the New York litigation. She has moved that I void that judgment because in November 2010, over two years before its entry, a procedural aspect of the New York case proceeded in spite of the automatic stay that (she alleges) was then in effect during her first bankruptcy case. I disagree, I will deny her motion, I will not void the New York judgment, and I will not issue any sanction for violation of the automatic stay."
"Is a creditor entitled to an award of attorneys' fees as automatic stay violation damages incurred in defending against debtor's frivolous postpetition state court action?","As noted above, Lei cannot recover damages for Yan's violation of the automatic stay, because Yan's actions did not interfere with the Trustee's administration of the estate. It is not appropriate to award Lei the fees she incurred in the State–Court Actions under the court's inherent powers to sanction bad-faith conduct in this court, because the conduct in question did not occur in this court."
"Is a claim against a debtor's employer for unpaid Social Security and Medicare taxes entitled to administrative expense status?","Employment tax is comprised of trust fund and non-trust fund taxes. The Internal Revenue Code requires employers to withhold federal income and social security taxes from salaries and wages of employees. An employer is required to remit these withheld amounts to the government on behalf of the employee. Employers hold these taxes for the benefit of and in trust for the United States, as a result, these taxes are typically called “trust fund taxes” (referred to herein as the “Trust Fund Liability”). Employers are also responsible to match the amount of Social Security and Medicare taxes and remit these amounts to the government. As these amounts are the employer's responsibility, rather than amounts withheld from an employee's pay, these amounts are referred to as nontrust fund taxes (referred to herein as the “Employer Liability”)."
"Can a creditor of Chapter 11 debtors be granted derivative standing to pursue claims against an entity that, through its subsidiary, held 100% of the equity interests of each of the debtors?","“Whether a party should be granted derivative standing is a mixed question of law and fact.” In re Adelphia Commc'ns Corp., 371 B.R. 660, 665 (S.D.N.Y.2007), aff'd, 544 F.3d 420 (2d Cir.2008). A ruling on derivative standing represents an “application of bankruptcy courts' equitable powers,” and is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)."
"Does an abuse of Chapter 7 exist where debtors lived an above-standard lifestyle and had not modified their spending?","Thus, in virtually every category the Debtor's monthly expenses are higher than the applicable standards. The Court therefore concludes that the Debtor and his family are still living an above-standard lifestyle and have not significantly tightened their financial spending habits, notwithstanding their respective bankruptcies. It is baffling why the Debtor's wife acquired a Mercedes automobile the year following her Chapter 7 case and the Debtor failed to disclose her car payment on his original Schedule J. (UST Ex. No. 1.) Moreover, the Court is perplexed by the large size (3,750 square feet) and cost ($2,250) of the Debtor's home. (UST Ex. No. 4; Debtor Ex. No. 1.) A debtor's budget may be excessive or unreasonable because of high housing expenses. In re Crink, 402 B.R. 159, 171 (Bankr.M.D.N.C.2009). Due regard should be given to the size of the family, their reasonable needs, and the cost of alternative housing. Id. After a careful review of the Debtor's expenses, most of which exceed the IRS *896 Standards, the Court concludes that those expenses are excessive. The Debtor and his family live in a spacious luxury home and drive two luxury cars. His choice of housing and vehicles exceeds what is reasonably necessary to live in a modest and thrifty way. Courts have routinely dismissed cases where debtors would rather drive a luxury vehicle than repay debts. In re Mack, Bankr.No. 03–73942, 2004 WL 856425, at *2 (Bankr.C.D.Ill. Apr.20, 2004) (collecting cases). While the Debtor is not continuing to live in a castle in Spain at the expense of his unsecured creditors, see Bacardi, 2010 WL 54760 at *5 n. 2, he is living larger than reasonably necessary and has not attempted to reduce his expenses or lifestyle. No family in this District needs such expensive housing and vehicular transport to the detriment of their unsecured creditors. Indeed, the Debtor could have rented more reasonably priced but adequate housing. Instead, the Debtor chose expensive housing and luxury vehicles. The Debtor is asking the Court to allow him and his non-filing spouse to keep two luxury vehicles and rent an expensive house at the expense of the Debtor's unsecured creditors. The Court will not acquiesce. If the Debtor tightened his financial belt, he would have the ability to pay something to his unsecured creditors. Because he chose luxury over paying his creditors, the Court finds that the Debtor's financial situation demonstrates abuse. Accordingly, the Court grants the UST's motion and dismisses this case."
"Will confirmation be reversed where an individual's Chapter 11 debtor plan violates the absolute priority rule?","In order for a plan to be “fair and equitable” for purposes of § 1129(b), it must satisfy the absolute-priority rule. See Norwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers, 485 U.S. 197, 202, 108 S.Ct. 963, 99 L.Ed.2d 169 (1988). The rule has been “a cornerstone of equitable distribution for Chapter 11 creditors for over a century.” In re Lively, 717 F.3d 406, 410 (5th Cir.2013). Originally a judicial gloss upon the 1898 Bankruptcy Act, the absolute-priority rule was codified in the 1978 version of the Code. As codified, the rule provides that every unsecured creditor must be paid in full before the debtor can retain “any property” under a plan. 11 U.S.C. § 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii). The parties agree that the absolute-priority rule is not satisfied here. According to Cardin's bankruptcy filings, his assets include his home, valued at $420,000, his ice machines, valued in total at $320,000, and a 2011 Ford F150 pickup truck, valued at $30,000. Two of Cardin's creditors are more than fully secured: Citizen's National Bank holds mortgages totaling approximately $543,000 on the home and ice machines, leaving Cardin with almost $200,000 of equity in those assets; and Ford Motor credit has a $15,429 claim secured by the F150, leaving Cardin with about $14,500 of equity in the truck. Cardin's plan allows him to retain all of these assets after paying off the loans they secure. Meanwhile, the plan requires Cardin to make a single payment of $124,000 towards Ice House's unsecured claim of $1.545 million. The plan also requires Cardin to “remit” to Ice House the amount of any disposable income that he earns during the five years following the plan's confirmation (but not any income thereafter)."
"Will discharge be denied where a debtor knowingly and fraudulent makes a false oath or account relating to the debtor's property and financial affairs?","Under section 727(a)(4), the Trustee must establish that Debtor made a false statement under oath in connection with the case, the oath related to a material fact, the oath was made knowingly and the oath was made fraudulently. In re Retz, 606 F.3d 1189, 1197 (9th Cir.2010); see also In re Searles, 317 B.R. 368 (9th Cir. BAP2004), aff'd, 212 F. App'x 589 (9th Cir.2006). A false statement or an omission from debtor's schedules or statement of financial affairs may constitute a false oath. Id.; see also In re Khalil, 379 B.R. 163, 172 (9th Cir. BAP2007), aff'd 578 F.3d 1167 (9th Cir.2009). A false statement is material if “the statement bears a relationship ... to the debtor's estate, and concerns the discovery of assets ... or the existence and disposition of the debtor's property.” Khalil, 379 B.R. at 173; see also Retz, 606 F.3d at 1198. The value of the omitted asset or the lack of injury to creditors is not material, but the “false statement must relate materially to the debtor's financial affairs or the bankruptcy process.” Downey, 242 B.R. at 14. A debtor acts knowingly if he acts “deliberately and consciously.” Retz, 606 F.3d at 1198. And, last, a debtor's fraudulent intent can be proved by direct and circumstantial evidence, including inferences from the debtor's conduct and all surrounding circumstances. Id. A pattern of falsity, or even a single false oath, or statements made with a reckless disregard of its truth suffices. Id.; In re Downey, 242 B.R. at 13."
"What is the proper valuation of a motor vehicle securing a creditor's claim?","We begin with the text of the Bankruptcy Code. In re Allied Mech. Servs., Inc., 885 F.2d 837, 838 (11th Cir.1989). Section 506(a)(2)'s text—“[i]f the debtor is an individual in a case under chapter 7 or 13, such value ... shall be determined based on the replacement value”—expressly requires applying a replacement value standard in cases falling within its ambit. And the cases that fall within the scope of § 506(a)(2)'s ambit include those involving a Chapter 13 debtor's personal property or property for personal, family, or household use—precisely the kind at issue here. Section 506(a)(2), by its plain terms, applies to this case."
"When will nondischargeability of a debt to a judgment creditor under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(6) be established by collateral estoppel?","Based on all of the foregoing, this Court finds in this case that the Bankruptcy Court properly gave preclusive effect to the District Court's decision on the issue of “malicious and willful” conduct, because this decision determined nondischargeability. Specifically, the Bankruptcy Court correctly determined that the District Court judgment was for the intentional tort of conversion, that as part of its judgment the District Court found that the acts were done in a “malicious and willful manner,” and that the judgment renders the debt nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6). Because “the primary debt[s are] nondischargeable due to willful and malicious conduct, the attorney's fees and interest accompanying compensatory damage[s], including post-judgment interest, are likewise nondischargeable.” Gober, 100 F.3d at 1208; accord In re Milton, 355 B.R. at 586 (“there is ample authority ... for the proposition that where wil[l]fullness and malice exist, compensatory and punitive damages flowing therefrom are nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6) (quotation marks and citations omitted)). Therefore, this Court finds that the Bankruptcy Court did not err in its decision. D. Conclusion In sum, having reviewed the Bankruptcy Court's findings of facts and its conclusions of law under the appropriate standards, this Court AFFIRMS the August 25, 2014 decision of the Bankruptcy Court in all respects."
"Will a debtor's case be converted or dismissed due to their failure to timely file a disclosure statement and plan?","See 11 U.S.C. § 1121(e)(3) (emphasis added). The Debtors argue that that their filing of monthly operating reports and negotiations with creditors demonstrates good cause to not dismiss the case. This in no way covers the aforementioned extension requirements. “Judges are not mind-readers, so parties must spell out their issues clearly, highlighting the relevant facts and analyzing on-point authority.” Rodriguez v. Municipality of San Juan, 659 F.3d 168, 175 (1st Cir.2011). Even if Debtors had made a Section 1121(e)(3) argument, the existing 300–day period has expired, making any Section 1121(e)(3) argument moot. As a result, Debtors have failed to file a disclosure statement and plan under statutorily prescribed period, making their case's dismissal appropriate."
"What remedies are available to the bankruptcy court in dismissing a Chapter 13 case for bad faith?","There are two issues before the Court: (1) whether the Debtor's right to dismiss under Section 1307(b) of the Bankruptcy Code trumps the Chapter 13 Trustee's Motion to Dismiss the Case with Prejudice; and (2) whether the Debtor's bad faith gives the Court cause to order that the Trustee disburse the remaining funds to the creditors pursuant to Section 349(b)(3), instead of returning them to the Debtor under § 1326(a)(2) of the Code. The Court will address each issue, in turn."
"Is a creditor recording artist's claim for royalties entitled to administrative expense status?","As to an alleged post-petition use, Young acknowledges that Young's compensation for any use by DRR of his intellectual property would be “in the form of Royalties that become due and owing upon DRR's actual sale of Young's Records.” However, Young has failed to adequately allege actual post-petition sales of Young's Records."
"Should a debtor's application to retain counsel be denied for failure of the firm to disclose payment of the retainer by a creditor of the debtor?","The Firm argued that withdrawal of the Critical Vendor Motion cured any failure to disclose or a conflict (if one had existed). This is not correct; withdrawal of a document is not sufficient. Rather, a close and thorough inspection of possible relationships and the source of retainer funds are necessary. See generally In re EWC, Inc., 138 B.R. 276, 279–80 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1992) (holding that the court cannot adequately approve counsel unless full disclosure is provided by the professional to be employed); In re Saturley, 131 B.R. 509, 516 (Bankr.D. Me 1991) (holding that “a debtor's counsel has an affirmative duty punctiliously to disclose all its connections with the debtor”). Although the Court finds there was no adverse interest held by the Firm and there was no intent to hide the source and receipt of the retainer, the Firm did not disclose the fee arrangement in the Application and disclosed erroneous information in its Amended Application and Rule 2014 statement. The Firm's carelessness in investigating the source of its retainer payment makes disgorgement of a portion of the retainer received appropriate. See 11 U.S.C. § 328(c). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Firm shall disgorge $3,500 of the initial retainer to Debtor within ten (10) days of entry of this Order. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the United States Trustee's Objection is OVERRULED, the Firm's Amended Application is GRANTED, and that Debtor is authorized to employ The Eason Law Firm as lead bankruptcy counsel in this Chapter 11 case. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that The Eason Law Firm shall not be reimbursed for expenses or paid compensation out of Debtor's estate during the pendency of this case until further Order of this Court. Debtor's Counsel is directed to serve this Order on Debtor, the United States Trustee, all creditors, and any party-in-interest and file a Certificate of Service reflecting the same."
"Is a former spouse's claim that was not for a domestic support obligation entitled to priority treatment?","Given the disparate income of the parties, the short duration of the marriage and the tenor of the Agreement as a whole, the Court concludes that the Obligations are not a ""domestic support obligation"" under § 101 and the Obligations are not entitled to priority treatment under § 507."
"Does a trustee have standing to settle a fraudulent transfer claim against debtor's non-debtor business?","During his investigation of the Debtor's books and records, the Trustee discovered that the Debtor had made a number of transfers to its principals and affiliated entities (collectively, the “Non–Debtor Defendants”), which were potentially subject to avoidance under the Bankruptcy Code and Florida law. The Trustee also determined that these transfers rendered indistinguishable the assets of the Debtor and Non–Debtor Defendants. As a result, on February 18, 2011, the Trustee filed a complaint (the Adversary Proceeding) against the Debtor and the Non–Debtor Defendants to recover the allegedly fraudulent transfers made between the Debtor and the Non–Debtor Defendants during the time leading up to the bankruptcy case."
"If a debtor files taxes seven years after they are due and after the IRS commenced collection proceedings, does this constitute a ""return"" and is related tax debt nondischargeable?","Like the taxpayers in Hindenlang and Payne, the Debtor here did not file his tax return until after the IRS had performed its assessment. The Debtor argues that he never received the deficiency notices mailed to him by the IRS because he moved to a new address, does not claim that he notified the IRS of his change of address. The Debtor's failure to inform the IRS that he moved and subsequent failure to comply with any of the deficiency notices, and his failure to file until after the IRS performed an assessment, demonstrates that the Debtor did not make an honest and reasonable attempt to comply with the tax law. As a result, the Debtor's Forms 1040 for 2006 and 2007 do not constitute tax returns for the purposes of § 523. Given this conclusion, it is unnecessary to determine whether any late filed document may qualify as a “return” for the purposes of § 523. In re Casano, 473 B.R. 504 (E.D.N.Y.2012) (holding that it is unnecessary to address the One Day Late Rule when the debtor filed his Form 1040 after the IRS had performed an assessment.) Because the Debtor waited until after the IRS had performed its assessments before filing his returns, the Debtor's Forms 1040 did not demonstrate an honest and reasonable attempt to comply with the tax law and therefore cannot be considered returns under the definition provided by the Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code."
"Can a trustee avoid debtor's transfer of interest in workers' compensation settlement that occurred two years before the petition date?","In Counts I and V of his complaint the Trustee seeks to avoid as preferential certain payments made by Alpha to J. Harrison and HMCG. Avoidance actions under 11 U.S.C. § 547 deal with transfers made between a debtor and creditor prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. Section 547 allows a trustee to avoid pre-petition transfers made by a debtor to a creditor, provided that each element of § 547(b) is met. 11 U.S.C. § 547(b). To do so, “the trustee must show that the payment was (1) to the creditor, (2) on account of a previous debt, (3) made while the debtor was insolvent, (4) made [within] 90 days before the bankruptcy petition was filed, and (5)[was] effective in enabling the creditor to receive more than it would have received had the debtor's estate been liquidated under Chapter 7.” In re Globe Mfg. Corp., 567 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2009) (citing 11 U.S.C. § 547(b)). At issue in this case is whether the Trustee has adequately pled facts to establish the Debtor's insolvency at the time of the payments, that the payments were made during the applicable reach back period, and that the payments allowed J. Harrison and HMCG to receive more than each would have received under a Chapter 7 distribution if the payments had not been made."
"When is a creditor's motion in a breach of guaranty action a violation of the discharge injunction?","Three years later in Zilog, the Ninth Circuit again reiterated its approval of Hardy's two-part test for finding a willful violation of the discharge injunction as stated in Bennett and Dyer. In re Zilog, 450 F.3d at 1007, 1008 n. 12 (noting that a contempt order entered for violation of the automatic stay or discharge injunction is governed by the same standards, namely those applicable to all civil contempt proceedings). In Zilog, the Ninth Circuit provided further guidance on the “actual knowledge” requirement under the first prong of the test. First, the court made clear that whether a party has actual knowledge of the injunction is a fact-based inquiry and must be found; it can neither be presumed nor imputed. In re Zilog, 450 F.3d at 1007–08. Second, the Ninth Circuit further explained there must be evidence showing that the alleged contemnor was aware of the discharge injunction and that it was applicable to his or her claim. Id. at 1009."
"When will the enforcement of a channeling injunction be denied against a plaintiff in a state court asbestos case?","Not only would such an interpretation disregard the clear language of the channeling injunction, it would also overstep the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. The Second Circuit held in In re Johns–Manville Corp. that the federal courts are without jurisdiction to enjoin actions against third-parties not in bankruptcy when those actions are premised upon an “independent legal duty.” 517 F.3d 52, 63 (2d Cir.N.Y.2008) (hereinafter “Manville I” ). Although appellants correctly note that the Supreme Court reversed this decision in Travelers Indem. Co. v. Bailey, it did so on purely procedural grounds and “[did] not resolve whether a bankruptcy court, in 1986 or today, could properly enjoin claims against nondebtor insurers that are not derivative of the debtor's wrongdoing.” 557 U.S. 137, ––––, 129 S.Ct. 2195, 2207, 174 L.Ed.2d 99 (U.S.2009). The Second Circuit hewed to its Manville I analysis on remand. In re Johns–Manville Corp., 600 F.3d 135, 158 (2d Cir.2010). Judge Ware's analysis clearly demonstrates that appellees have an independent, direct cause of action premised upon an independent legal duty that appellants owe to appellees. Furthermore, appellants have made no showing that appellees claims would in any way affect the res of the debtor's estate. See Manville I, 517 F.3d at 66. Even if this Court were to interpret the channeling injunction anew, it would decline to interpret the channeling injunction in the manner that appellants espouse because to do so would exceed the subject matter jurisdiction of the Court."
"Can an excess insurer intervene in a bankruptcy proceeding seeking approval of a settlement agreement between the debtor and another party?","It's not as if, unless Columbia can sue, no secondary insurer (whether an excess insurer, as in this case, or a reinsurer) can protect itself against its insureds' making settlements with their primary insurers that disadvantage the secondary insurer. An excess insurer can write a policy that does not require it to pay until the coverage limit of the primary policy, $10 million in this case, has been reached. Or the excess policy could provide that its coverage limit would drop down if the primary insurer proved to be insolvent, as Integrity proved to be. This would give the excess insurer a concrete stake in the bankruptcy, thus enabling it to file an objection to an attempt by the bankruptcy judge to disregard the provision in the excess policy in order to maximize the assets of the debtor available for distribution to the creditors. It is better to leave matters to private contracting where that is feasible than to permit parties, especially sophisticated parties like Columbia, to ask a court to ride to its rescue from an oversight."
"Can one creditor enforce the provisions of a Chapter 11 plan against another creditor?","(b)(1) Notwithstanding section 510(a) of this title, if all of the applicable requirements of subsection (a) of this section other than paragraph (8) are met with respect to a plan, the court, on request of the proponent of the plan, shall confirm the plan notwithstanding the requirements of such paragraph if the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan."
"Does the confirmation of debtor's Chapter 13 plan create a nondischargeable debt with respect to a pre-filing executory contract which debtor hasn't assumed or rejected?","The Priesters' objection to confirmation includes objections to the value Reasor assesses to the trailer and her failure to provide for the contract's payment in full. They further ask that if the Agreement be found to be a secured transaction, Ms. Reasor should be required to repay the trailer's value to them over the life of the plan. Theirs is the only confirmation objection. Having concluded that the Agreement is an un-assumed or rejected executory contract, Ms. Reasor's obligations under it remain in effect and are unaltered by the plan. To the extent her plan payments are insufficient to pay the Priester's debt in full over the plan's life, she will remain indebted to them under the Agreement notwithstanding her discharge, if she receives one. Standing alone, her non-treatment of the Agreement is not a bar to confirming her plan, though it may be an obstacle to her performing it."
"Will a bankruptcy court commit reversible error by allowing debtor's gambling debts to be discharged despite high probability of harm to creditor casinos?","For the reasons explained above, the Bankruptcy Court's Final Judgment entered on November 13, 2013, is AFFIRMED."
"Was debtor's Chapter 11 plan improperly confirmed where debtor subordinated a punitive damages claim to general unsecured claims?","There only remaining rationale Appellants propose is that had it not been for Debtors' supposition that punitive claims would remain totally impaired in Class 6, they would have offered no “gift” to the other unsecured creditors in Class 4, because they feared tens of millions of dollars in other potential punitive damages awards. But Appellees' $4.2 million Claim cannot have contributed to any uncertainty over the potential for future punitive damages when Appellants proposed their plan, because Appellees' claim had already been reduced to judgment in state court and was due and owing like every other unsecured claim. The Court therefore affirms the bankruptcy court that putting Appellees' Claim into Class 6 in this case would have resulted in unfair discrimination under § 1129(b)(1). CONCLUSION IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the order of the bankruptcy court is AFFIRMED. IT IS SO ORDERED."
"Should debtor's Chapter 13 case filed 4 months after his Chapter 7 discharge be dismissed for lack of good faith?","The Debtor's second case was filed four months after he received his Chapter 7 discharge. The purpose of this filing was to avoid or delay paying Steinberg the non-dischargeable consent judgment. There was no other reason for the filing of the Chapter 13 case, as all debts that could have been discharged were discharged in the Chapter 7 case. The filing of the petition cannot be said to meet the good faith requirement of 11 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(7). It cannot be disputed that the Debtor's sole reason for filing this petition under Chapter 13 on the heels of the Chapter 7 discharge was to deal with the debt declared non-dischargeable by virtue of a consent order in the recent adversary proceeding. Filing a Chapter 13 case for the purpose of discharging a single non-dischargeable claim is recognized as a filing in bad faith. In re Moroney, 330 B.R. 527, 532 (B.C.E.D.Va.2005). A Chapter 13 case aimed at paying only a small portion of a non-dischargeable debt deserves particular scrutiny. In re Sellers, 285 B.R. 769, 773–74 (B.C.S.D.Ga.2001)."
"What is a casino creditor's burden of proof required in order to establish that debtor's gambling debts are nondischargeable?","The Bankruptcy Court did not err in finding that Appellants had failed to meet their burden of proving a willful and malicious injury by a preponderance of the evidence. As explained above, the record is devoid of any indication of D'Amico's knowledge of his financial condition at the time that he signed the markers. In fact, given the substantial sums D'Amico deposited with the casinos and the balances in the relevant bank accounts, it is unclear from the record whether D'Amico was in fact unable to pay the markers when he signed them. Moreover, Appellants made no effort to establish D'Amico's knowledge to the Bankruptcy Court. Instead, Appellants argued that harm was objectively substantially certain from the perspective of a reasonable person with perfect or complete knowledge of all of the relevant facts and circumstances. It was Appellants' burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that D'Amico possessed the requisite knowledge to make his acts substantially certain to result in injury to the casinos. The Bankruptcy Court concluded that Appellants had failed to do so. The court agrees."
"Is a default judgment against debtor in an adversary proceeding warranted due to improper service of summons and complaint?","In this case, the plaintiff did not demonstrate the criteria required under the default rules in order to establish the default of this defendant. Indeed, even its service of process commencing the adversary proceeding was insufficient, and without proper service the court cannot consider the subsequent Motion for Default Judgment. The plaintiff's Complaint was filed on November 4, 2013, and the summons was issued on November 5, 2013. Plaintiff, by counsel, served the Complaint and summons upon the defendant and his bankruptcy attorney on November 26, 2013. See R. 6; R. 7 (Mem. Support), at ¶ 2. However, the summons had expired on November 19, 2013. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7004(e) (requiring delivery of summons and complaint within 14 days after issuance of summons). The plaintiff did not seek an alias summons to effect proper service on the parties. See id.; see also In re Menges, 337 B.R. 191, 193 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2006) (""If service is not made in that time, the summons is stale, and another summons must be issued.""). It is clear that the untimely service was defective and that ""[s]ervice of a stale summons is no service at all."" Id. at 194. Moreover, service of the summons and complaint was not made ""within 120 days after the filing of the complaint,"" as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m) requires. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7004(a) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) in bankruptcy proceedings). Proper service pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 7004(e) is a prerequisite for timely service under Civil Rule 4(m). See Premier Capital, Inc. v. DeCarolis, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1879, 2002 WL 47134 at *6 (D.N.H. Jan. 4, 2002) (citing In re Love, 232 B.R. 373, 378 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1999), aff'd 242 B.R. 169 (E.D. Tenn. 1999) and 3 Fed. Appx. 497 (6th Cir. 2001)). The court concludes, therefore, that service was tardy and ineffective under Bankruptcy Rule 7004(e) and Civil Rule 4(m)."
"Will the bankruptcy court commit reversible error by rejecting the filing of a dischargeability complaint due to creditor's failure to file a motion to reopen the underlying bankruptcy case?","Further, while reopening a case for the purpose of filing a nondischargeability complaint is good practice, it is not necessary. “[A] separate motion to reopen is not a jurisdictional requirement, or even a prerequisite for commencing an action for nondischargeability of a debt under § 523(a)(3)(B).” Staffer v. Predovich (In Re Staffer), 306 F.3d 967, 972 (9th Cir.2002)."
"Is an oversecured creditor entitled to recover postpetition interest at the contract rate under 11 U.S.C.S. § 506(b)?","While the Bankruptcy Code governs postpetition interest, there is a rebuttable presumption that the parties' contract rate should apply. Id. at 134 (“[A] debtor bears the burden of rebutting the presumption that the contract rate of interest applies post-petition.”); see also In re Terry Ltd. P'ship, 27 F.3d 241, 243 (7th Cir.1994) (describing rebuttable presumption in favor of contract default rates of interest); In re Madison 92nd St. Assocs. LLC, 472 B.R. 189, 198 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2012) (“The great majority of courts have concluded that the appropriate rate of interest should be the ... so-called ‘contract rate’ of interest.”); Urban Communicators PCS Ltd.

"Is debtor's transfer of property to his mother for no consideration an avoidable fraudulent transfer in trustee's action under 11 U.S.C.S. § 548(a)(1)?","“Because proof of actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors may rarely be established by direct evidence, courts infer fraudulent intent from the circumstances surrounding the transfer.” Schilling v. Heavrin (In re Triple S. Rests., Inc.), 422 F.3d 405, 416 (6th Cir.2005). Such circumstances are reflected in the factors that are often referred to as the “badges of fraud”, which under Ohio law include: (1) Whether the transfer or obligation was to an insider; (2) Whether the debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer; (3) Whether the transfer or obligation was disclosed or concealed; (4) Whether before the transfer was made or the obligation incurred, the debtor had been sued or threatened with suit; (5) Whether the transfer was of substantially all of the assets of the debtor; (6) Whether the debtor absconded; (7) Whether the debtor removed or concealed assets; (8) Whether the value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred or the obligation incurred; (9) Whether the debtor was solvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred; (10) Whether the transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred; and (11) Whether the debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienholder who transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor. ORC § 1336.04(B). Once a plaintiff establishes a sufficient number of badges of fraud, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the debtor received a benefit or that there was some legitimate purpose for the transfer. Silagy v. Gagnon (In re Gabor), 280 B.R. 149, 157 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2002). “Although the presence of a single badge [of fraud] may only raise the suspicion of a debtor's fraudulent intent, the confluence of several badges can be conclusive evidence of fraudulent intent, absent significantly clear evidence of the debtor's legitimate supervening purpose.” Id."
"Can debtor modify a ""due on sale"" clause in his mortgage by confirming his Chapter 13 plan containing such terms and conditions?","“Pursuant to § 1322(b)(2), a debtor may not modify the rights of a secured creditor who has an interest in real property securing the debtor's principal residence.” In re Tewell, 355 B.R. at 681. In Nobelman, the United States Supreme Court has stated that the “rights” referred to in § 1322(b)(2) are those “reflected in the relevant mortgage instruments, which are enforceable under [state law].” Id. (citing Nobelman v. Am. Sav. Bank, 508 U.S. 324, 329, 113 S.Ct. 2106, 124 L.Ed.2d 228 (1993)). Due on sale clauses are valid and enforceable in Texas. Sonny Arnold, 633 S.W.2d at 811. “To allow debtors to effectively ignore due on sale clauses invoked by holders of home mortgages stretches the language of § 1322(b)(2) past the breaking point.” In re Tewell, 355 B.R. at 681."
"Is a partially secured creditor entitled to auto insurance proceeds after debtor damaged his car in an accident?","The primary issue concerns the payment of post-confirmation insurance proceeds after the debtors were involved in a vehicle accident. In November 2013, a deer and the debtors' 2005 Kia Sedona collided. Although we do not know what happened to the deer, State Farm Insurance has offered $3960 to cover the resulting damage to the Sedona in full satisfaction of its obligation under an insurance policy. The debtors argue that since AmeriCredit has been paid the entire amount of its allowed secured claim under the debtors' confirmed plan, the proceeds should be paid to the debtors so they can purchase another vehicle. The chapter 13 trustee argues that the proceeds are property of the estate and should be paid to the trustee for distribution to the debtors' unsecured creditors, subject to the debtors' requesting a refund for the purchase of another vehicle. AmeriCredit argues that the proceeds belong to AmeriCredit based on its recorded lien on the Kia Sedona."
"Does a creditor who did not file a proof of claim in the underlying bankruptcy be entitled to post-confirmation relief from stay in order to pursue foreclosure related claims?","Under 11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(1), a court may grant a party in interest relief from the automatic stay for “cause.” Such cause may encompass a party's need to pursue the resolution of pre-petition litigation against the debtor in state court. In re Residential Capital, LLC, 508 B.R. 838 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2014). A proceeding before the bankruptcy court under § 362(d)(1) is considered to be a “summary proceeding of limited effect.” In re Mullarkey, 536 F.3d 215, 226 (3d Cir. 2008). “[S]uch hearings do not involve a full adjudication on the merits of claims, defenses, or counterclaims, but [are] simply a determination as to whether a creditor has a colorable claim to property of the estate.” Id. Accordingly, it is appropriate for a bankruptcy court to decline to rule on the New Matter set forth in a debtor's answer to a relief from stay motion, especially when the ultimate issue raised in New Matter will be necessarily determined in the state court litigation."
"Is debtor's transfer of property sale proceeds to a bank in full satisfaction of unsecured debt avoidable as a preferential payment?","The Bank contends that no diminution of the estate occurred as a result of the sale nor was the interest of any unsecured creditor prejudiced by its receipt of the $2.1 million because the funds which it received “were exempt sale proceeds from exempt homestead property” which would have never been available to the estate's creditors. Of course, the generous homestead protections provided under state constitutional and statutory law to Texas citizens are well-known, and included among such protections is a temporary, six-month exemption of proceeds derived from the sale of a homestead from the claims of creditors so that such proceeds can be reinvested in another homestead. “The purpose of the exemption on home sale proceeds is not to protect the proceeds, in and of themselves but rather, solely to allow the claimant to invest the proceeds in another homestead.” Hill v. Jones (In re Jones), 327 B.R. 297, 302 (Bankr.S.D.Tex.2005) (citing Zibman v. Tow (In re Zibman), 268 F.3d 298, 305 (5th Cir.2001) (emphasis in original)). The legislative intent behind this exemption is to protect Texas residents from homelessness during periods of homestead transitions. Id. The selling homestead owner is allowed to hold the homestead sale proceeds for purchase of another homestead within the designated protection period, “but not to make purchases of other assets or items or otherwise dispose of the money in a way that would prejudice the interests of his creditors in his assets.” In re Zavala, 366 B.R. 643, 653 (Bankr.W.D.Tex.2007) (citing Jones, 327 B.R. at 302). The protections afforded by § 41.001(c) terminate when a new homestead is acquired. Studensky v. Morgan (In re Morgan), 481 Fed.Appx. 183, 187 (5th Cir.2012); In re Garcia, 499 B.R. 506, 513–14 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.2013), aff'd sub nom. Garcia v. Bassel, 507 B.R. 907 (N.D.Tex.2014)."
"Should recognition of foreign main bankruptcy proceeding be vacated due to questionable conduct of a foreign representative?","Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code, like the Model Law on Cross–Border Insolvency, is intended to facilitate cross-border cooperation in insolvency proceedings. One of the purposes of chapter 15 is the “fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies that protects the interests of all creditors, and other interested entities, including the debtor....” 11 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(3). Other sections of chapter 15 provide for relief “only if the interests of the creditors and other interested entities, including the debtor, are sufficiently protected,” 11 U.S.C. § 1522(a), and allow additional assistance when necessary to “reasonably assure ... protection of claim holders in the United States against prejudice and inconvenience in the processing of claims in [a] foreign proceeding,” id. § 1507(b)(2). The Code, however, does not describe what a U.S. court should do when, after granting recognition to a foreign proceeding, the conduct of the foreign representative, or other parties in interest, flout the purposes of chapter 15. The pending motion seeking to vacate recognition of a Mexican insolvency proceeding raises troubling questions about the conduct of a foreign representative in this chapter 15 case and in the ongoing Mexican proceeding, and requires consideration of the Court's role in protecting U.S. creditors."
"Should the court grant defendant's motion for acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c) after the jury found him guilty of bankruptcy fraud under 18 U.S.C.S. § 157?","The court is persuaded that the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude, either directly or through inference, that defendant had the requisite intent to defraud his creditors when he made the false statements in his bankruptcy petition. While the creditors' knowledge of defendant's assets may be a factor relevant to a determination of defendant's fraudulent intent, it is not dispositive of the absence of fraudulent purpose. See Grant, 971 F.2d at 809 (“Although the replacement of removed property may be probative evidence of lack of fraudulent intent [under 18 U.S.C. § 152], it is not dispositive.”); United States v. Klupt, 475 F.2d 1015, 1018–19 (2d Cir.1973) (return of property not dispositive of fraudulent intent under 18 U.S.C. § 152). In addition, even if the jury was presented with apparently conflicting evidence, the resolution of those conflicts is the province of the jury, not this court. The court concludes that the evidence is sufficient to convince any rational trier of fact that the crime charged has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient is DENIED."
"Are insurance proceeds obtained by the debtor from the state division of unclaimed funds considered property of the estate that can be recovered by the trustee and distributed to the creditors?","The defendants next argue that the debtor did not have an interest in the funds at filing because he did not know that the State held the funds and he did not have the power to demand their disbursement until he obtained the judgment, post-filing. This argument fails for two reasons. First, the argument mis-characterizes the nature of unclaimed funds, which remain the property of the original owner under Ohio's Unclaimed Funds Act. Sogg v. Zurz, 121 Ohio St. 3d 449, 2009 Ohio 1526, 905 N.E.2d 187, 191 (Ohio 2009). Therefore, the judgment did not create the debtor's interest in the insurance proceeds. Instead, the debtor's interest in the insurance proceeds necessarily preceded and provided the basis for the state court judgment. Second, the argument does not recognize the broad definition of property.  The definition includes all legal and equitable interests of thedebtor in property at the commencement of the case, as well as any interest in property that the estate acquires after the case is filed. Thedebtor's rights with respect to the insurance proceeds originated prepetition under the terms of the insurance policy, regardless of the fact that the debtor did not know he had a right to claim the funds until after filing his chapter 7 case. The debtor's rights to the funds became property of the estate when he filed his case in 2010. See Demczyk v. Mut. Life Ins. Co. of N.Y. ( In re Graham Square, Inc.), 126 F.3d 823, 831 (6th Cir.1997)(stating that  ""property of the estate includes the debtor's interest in a cause of action"" and also ""allows the bankruptcy trustee to regain possession of property in which the debtor has equitable as well as legal title""). Because the debtor's rights with respect to the funds wereproperty of the bankruptcy estate, the estate acquired the sole right to the funds under the state court judgment.  The trustee is now entitled to turnover of the funds under Bankruptcy Code § 542(a). See 11 U.S.C. § 542(a) (providing for turnover of property that thetrustee may use unless it is of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate). VII. CONCLUSION For the reasons stated, the $51,022.37 in insurance proceeds are determined to be property of the chapter 7 estate and subject to turnover. A separate judgment will be entered in favor of the plaintiff-trustee to reflect this decision."
"What is the Trustee's burden of proof under 11 U.S.C.S. § 110 for sanctioning a bankruptcy petition preparer for charging excessive fees?","Under Section 110, the burden of proving the reasonableness of a fee collected by a bankruptcy petition preparer rests upon the petition preparer. See, e.g., In re Froehlich, 23 Fed.Appx. 572, 574, 2001 WL 1530594 (7th Cir.2001)(petition preparer, as the party seeking fees, “has the burden of establishing that he or she is entitled to them once a question regarding their reasonableness has been raised.”); In re Haney, 284 B.R. 841, 850–51 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2002)(same); In re Doser, 281 B.R. 292, 313 (Bankr.D.Idaho 2002)(same); In re Bush, 275 B.R. 69, 85–86 (Bankr.D.Idaho 2002)(same). In this case, the Bankruptcy Administrator has shown that Mr. Williams acted as a petition preparer and that he collected a fee from the Debtor. The burden of proof regarding the reasonableness of Mr. Williams' fee rested with Mr. Williams, who failed to attend the hearing and thus failed to show, by a preponderance of the evidence or any other standard, that the fee that he collected was reasonable compensation for his services as a petition preparer. Because he has failed to prove the reasonableness of his fee, the Court finds that all fees paid to Mr. Williams are in excess of the value of his services.5 Therefore, Mr. Williams shall turn over $100.00, the entirety of the fee received, to the Trustee."
"Is judgment debt for copyright violations from a state proceeding considered nondischargeable where the debtor bar manager permitted and sanctioned unlicensed public music performances?","Here, the District Court found the Debtor “vicariously liable for copyright infringements which occurred at Bobby Music because he had both a direct financial interest in the sale of the copyrighted materials, and a right and ability to supervise the employee responsible for the sales....” Copyright Summary Judgment Order at *5. But the District Court also held the Debtor in contempt of the Preliminary Injunction, and awarded $330,000, in damages arising out of that contempt. Contempt Order at *14. See Copyright Summary Judgment Order at *5. That contempt damages award, not an award of damages arising out of vicarious liability, is the subject of Yash Raj's Section 523(a)(6) claim. See Yash Raj's Supplemental Memorandum in Support of the Summary Judgment Motion at 7, Adversary Proceeding Docket, Entry 25. As in In re Blankfort, the District Court's “finding of ‘blatant and willful’ contempt of court orders by the ... Debtor, which is binding upon this Court under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, constitutes the type of aggravated misconduct which warrants an imputation of malice within the meaning of section 523(a)(6).” In re Blankfort, 217 B.R. at 146. Based on the entire record, the Court concludes that Yash Raj has demonstrated that each of the elements of collateral estoppel is satisfied with respect to the element of malice under Section 523(a)(6). First, the identical issue of malice, or whether the Debtor's conduct in violating the Preliminary Injunction was wrongful and without just cause or excuse, was raised in a previous proceeding, the Copyright Action. Second, the issue of whether the Debtor's actions were wrongful and without just cause or excuse was actually litigated in the Copyright Action and decided in the Contempt Order. Third, the parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the Copyright Action. Finally, the District Court's finding in the Contempt Order that the Debtor's actions were wrongful and without just cause or excuse was necessary to support its valid and final judgment that the Debtor was in contempt of the Preliminary Injunction and its award of contempt damages corresponding to the maximum statutory damages available under the Copyright Act. Conclusion For all of these reasons and based on the entire record, the Court concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact that the contempt damages in the amount of $330,000, plus attorneys' fees and costs, awarded against the Debtor by the District Court in the Contempt Order are nondischargeable under Section 523(a)(6), and that Yash Raj is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, Yash Raj's Summary Judgment Motion is granted and the Debtor's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment is denied. A separate order in conformity with this Memorandum Decision shall be entered simultaneously herewith."
"Is debtor and creditor's consensual agreement to pay creditor post-bankruptcy discharge grounds for sanctions against creditor for violation of the discharge injunction?","The Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 524(c), governs the enforcement of agreements between a creditor and a debtor involving dischargeable debts (a so-called “reaffirmation agreement”). Section 524(c) provided at the time of the agreements (1999): (c) An agreement between a holder of a claim and the debtor, the consideration for which, in whole or in part, is based on a debt that is dischargeable in a case under this title is enforceable only to any extent enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law, whether or not discharge of such debt is waived, only if— (1) such agreement was made before the granting of the discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228, or 1328 of this title; (2)(A) such agreement contains a clear and conspicuous statement which advises the debtor that the agreement may be rescinded at any time prior to discharge or within sixty days after such agreement is filed with the court, whichever occurs later, by giving notice of rescission to the holder of such claim; and (B) such agreement contains a clear and conspicuous statement which advises the debtor that such agreement is not required under this title, under non-bankruptcy law, or under any agreement not in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. ... (3) such agreement has been filed with the court and, if applicable, accompanied by a declaration or an affidavit of the attorney that represented the debtor during the course of negotiating an agreement under this subsection, which states that— (A) such agreement represents a fully informed and voluntary agreement by the debtor; (B) such agreement does not impose an undue hardship on the debtor or a dependent of the debtor; and (C) the attorney fully advised the debtor of the legal effect and consequences of— (i) an agreement of the kind specified in this subsection; and (ii) any default under such an agreement; 11 U.S.C. § 524(c) (1999) (emphasis added). “The reaffirmation rules are intended to protect debtors from compromising their fresh start by making unwise agreements to repay dischargeable debts. Because of the danger that creditors may coerce debtors into undesirable reaffirmation agreements, they are not favored under the Bankruptcy Code and strict compliance with the specific terms in Section 524 is mandatory. A reaffirmation agreement which does not comply fully with Section 524 is void and unenforceable.” In re Getzoff, 180 B.R. 572, 574 (9th Cir. BAP 1995) (citations omitted); In re Kinion, 207 F.3d 751, 756 (5th Cir.2000) (reaffirmation agreement “flawed” under 11 U.S.C. § 524(c) is “unenforceable”). Here, Appellant argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred in finding the Post–Confirmation Agreements to be unenforceable. As an initial matter, the Bankruptcy Court did not err in finding that the Post–Confirmation Agreements failed to comply with the requirements of 11 U.S.C. § 524(c). Specifically, the agreements were not (1) “made before the granting of discharge,” (2) they do not contain the disclosures required by Section 524(c), and (3) the agreement was not “filed with the court.” This precludes enforcement under Section 524(c). See In re Kinion, 207 F.3d at 756 (5th Cir.2000)."
"Can debtor's Chapter 13 plan be confirmed where debtor is attempting to cure his tax deficiency after the issuance of a default judgment against debtor?","In the Proposed Plan, the Pinedas asserted the right to “cure” the default reflected by the Foreclosure Judgment through § 1322(b)(3). However, the limitations on the right to cure a default on residential real property have been the subject of numerous decisions. An excellent discussion of the application of § 1322 to the County's interest in the Property is found in McCarn v. WyHy Fed. Credit Union (In re McCarn), 218 B.R. 154, 159–62 (10th Cir. BAP 1998).As noted in McCarn, § 1322(b)(2) and (5) only authorize a chapter 13 debtor to “cure” within certain constraints a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence. The fundamental problem the Pinedas face is found in § 1322(c), which provides: Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2) and applicable nonbankruptcy law— (1) a default with respect to, or that gave rise to, a lien on debtor's principal residence may be cured under paragraph (3) or (5) of subsection (b) until such residence is sold at a foreclosure sale that is conducted in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law. (Emphasis added.) In this case, because Oregon law provides that the issuance by the County Clerk of a certified copy of the Default Judgment constitutes a foreclosure sale of the Property to the County, § 1322(c)(1) applies to prohibit the Pinedas' from exercising any “cure” of their default in payment of their real property taxes."
"Does debtor have standing to pursue an employment discrimination claim if she failed to list the claim in her schedules but sought leave to reopen her case to amend the schedules?","Section 554(c) provides that “any property scheduled under section 521(a)(1) of this title not otherwise administered at the time of the closing of a case is abandoned to the debtor and administered for purposes of section 350 of this title.” 11 U.S.C. § 554(c). That is precisely what happened here. Although David did not initially schedule his ADA claim against WalMart, the bankruptcy court reopened his case to permit him to schedule the claim, and then quickly re-closed the case without the trustee “otherwise administering” the claim. The trustee thus abandoned the estate's interest in the claim, whose ownership reverted to David. See Spaine, 756 F.3d at 546 (“The bankruptcy case had been reopened and then closed again after the trustee undoubtedly knew about the civil case. That sequence of events indicated that the trustee had abandoned the lawsuit as property of the Chapter 7 estate, so the property reverted to the debtor.”); Matthews, 316 Fed.Appx. at 521 (“Matthews's discrimination claims reverted to her when the Chapter 7 case was reopened and then closed again after amended schedules including those claims were filed.”). David therefore has standing to pursue his claim against Wal–Mart. See Spaine, 756 F.3d at 546; Cannon–Stokes, 453 F.3d at 448."
"Can debtor's age discrimination lawsuit against employer be dismissed for debtor's failure to disclose the suit in the schedules?","The instruction on the Statement of Financial Affairs was clear enough: “List all suits and administrative proceedings to which the debtor is or was a party within one year immediately preceding the filing of this bankruptcy case.” Marshall understood that her three pending discrimination claims were, as she admitted in her affidavit, “administrative proceedings.” She could not have overlooked these claims. Her attorney alleges that in November 2005, she told the bankruptcy trustee that Marshall's pending EEOC claims for race and sex discrimination and retaliation, “had a value of at least $100,000 ... and [perhaps] more depending on what a jury might award for punitive damages.” A few weeks later, Marshall filed an age discrimination complaint in federal court seeking more than $2 million in damages. And when Marshall finally amended her bankruptcy schedules in 2010 to include this lawsuit, she listed its value as $1,000,000. For all of these reasons, Judge Lamberth, the district judge in this case, quite properly invoked judicial estoppel to grant summary judgment in favor of the defendants."
"Is debtor entitled to an award of attorneys' fees due to his former spouse's failure to complete settlement of claims from their divorce?","It is clear from the record that Debtor and Ms. Harbaugh have been dueling for many years. But Ms. Harbaugh agreed to settle the disputes joined in this Court. The Court can neither discern nor envision any purpose to be served by Ms. Harbaugh's actions other than to continue the battle, circumvent the settlement, delay progress of this case, and/or harass Debtor. And she failed to articulate or illustrate any justifiable or proper purpose for her conduct. Thus, the Court is compelled to find that Ms. Harbaugh's motives in failing to complete the settlement and attempting to re-raise issues with the trustee and the Court were for an improper purpose. It is, therefore, appropriate to grant an award of attorneys' fees to counsel for Debtor. Counsel for Debtor has submitted to the Court an itemization of time expended and a calculation of attorneys' fees based thereon. The Court having reviewed the itemization, finds that a reasonable fee for time expended is $3527.00."
"Does a creditor who holds a secured claim have a right pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 363(k) to credit bid its own claim at a sale of the debtor's assets?","Interestingly, both the right to bid and the right to offset are further conditioned by the language of § 363(k), which states that the two rights may be exercised “unless the court for cause orders otherwise.” 11 U.S.C. § 363(k). Thus, the bankruptcy court “for cause” may order that the right to bid or the right to offset, as both are articulated under the normal procedure of § 363(k), be modified or denied.9 “Cause” is not statutorily defined in the Bankruptcy Code. “Because the Code provides no definition of what constitutes ‘cause’ ..., courts must determine whether discretionary relief is appropriate on a case-by-case basis.” In re Laguna Associates Ltd. Partnership, 30 F.3d 734, 737 (6th Cir.1994). “Although what constitutes cause is ‘discretionary with the bankruptcy court,’ this discretion does not give the bankruptcy court the authority to act arbitrarily or to be freewheeling. In other words, the standard is not standardless.” In re Davis, 237 B.R. 177, 182 (M.D.Ala.1999). Intrinsically, acting “for cause” looks to the court's equity powers that allow the court to balance the interests of the debtor, its creditors, and the other parties of interests in order to achieve the maximization of the estate and an equitable distribution to all creditors. See Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U.S. 33, 51, 128 S.Ct. 2326, 171 L.Ed.2d 203 (2008); N.L.R.B. v. Bildisco and Bildisco, 465 U.S. 513, 527, 104 S.Ct. 1188, 79 L.Ed.2d 482 (1984); Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 336, 86 S.Ct. 467, 15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1966) (“bankruptcy courts are inherently proceedings in equity”). However, “whatever equitable powers remain in the bankruptcy courts must and can only be exercised within the confines of the Bankruptcy Code.” Law v. Siegel, ––– U.S. ––––, 134 S.Ct. 1188, 1194–95, 188 L.Ed.2d 146 (2014) (quoting Norwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers, 485 U.S. 197, 206, 108 S.Ct. 963, 99 L.Ed.2d 169 (1988)) (quotation marks omitted). Here, the language of § 363(k), “unless the court for cause orders otherwise,” allows the bankruptcy court to exercise its inherent equitable powers to modify or deny the rights otherwise provided under § 363(k). See also 11 U.S.C. § 105(a). The confines of § 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code statutorily provide that the bankruptcy court may exercise its equitable powers.10 Therefore, “credit bidding” under § 363(k) does not allow the holder of an allowed secured claim to exercise an absolute right to purchase its collateral and offset that purchase by its allowed secured claim. See, for example, In re The Free Lance–Star Publishing Co. of Fredericksburg, VA, 512 B.R. 798, 2014 WL 2505627, *5 (Bankr.E.D.Va.2014) (“Credit bidding ... is not an absolute right.”); In re Fisker Automotive Holdings, Inc., 510 B.R. 55, 59 (Bankr.D.Del.2014) (“... the right to credit bid is not absolute.”); In re Theroux, 169 B.R. 498, 499, n. 3 (Bankr.D.R.I.1994) (“... there is no absolute entitlement to credit bid ...”).11 The bankruptcy court should only modify or deny a § 363(k) credit bid when equitable concerns give it cause. This court believes such a modification or denial of credit bid rights should be the extraordinary exception and not the norm."
"Does res judicata apply to disallow creditor's domestic support claim where a settlement agreement was already reached in a prior turnover proceeding between the trustee and the creditor?","Federal law determines whether an earlier judgment, rendered in a federal court, bars the maintenance of a subsequent federal court action. Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 37 (1st Cir.1998). Under federal law, “a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.” Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980). Thus, the elements of a res judicata defense are (1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier proceeding, (2) sufficient identicality between the causes of action asserted in the earlier and later suits, and (3) sufficient identicality between the parties in the two actions. Gonzalez v. Banco Cent. Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st Cir.1994)."
"Can a creditor claim a lien on proceeds from sale of assets in a Chapter 11 if that creditor did not have a valid perfected prepetition security interest?","The Court has addressed separately the validity and extent of DSP's liens. The Court has held that DSP does not have a valid perfected security interest in all of the assets upon which it asserts it does. DSP does not have valid, properly perfected liens on, or security interests in, the Debtors' Tower Assets, the Debtors' motor vehicles, the Debtors' FCC licenses, the Debtors' insurance policies, or the Debtors' bank account deposits. DSP's lien on general intangibles does not give it a lien on the proceeds the Debtors will generate from the bankruptcy sale. The Court has denied Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and has granted partial judgment on Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. DSP does not have a right to assert a credit bid on assets that do not secure DSP's allowed claim."
"Can a debtor be denied a discharge injunction upon conclusion of the bankruptcy for withholding financial records and failure to explain loss of assets?","Here, Gary Belk has never provided information by which the bankruptcy Trustee could even know definitively what assets were owned by Independence Entertainment, LLC or, alternatively, Gary Belk relating to his sweepstakes business. With no records, there is simply no way of knowing what these assets were. Until the trial, Gary Belk had never truthfully explained to the Trustee what happened to these assets. He didn't disclose them, and then upon discovery, suggested that they had been transferred in an arms length deal to a third party in exchange for an assumption of debts. It was only at trial that it was learned that Gary Belk surrendered these business assets to his brother in a potentially avoidable transfer. Even after the trial, Gary Belk cannot provide, in account form, the business records by which the particular assets and the putative liabilities can be verified. The discharge must be denied under Section § 727(a)(5)."
"Should debtor's objection to postconfirmation amendments to proof of claim by successor to original creditor be sustained where debtor's plan was unambiguous?","Consequently, in this district, plan confirmation generally occurs prior to the expiration of the deadline for filing proofs of claim, and plans contain language specifically carving out the claims resolution process as separate from confirmation by preserving the right to object to claims post-confirmation. See Johnson, 279 B.R. at 226 (“This plan reserves all such [allowance or disallowance] questions until after the claims bar date when information is available to evaluate claims and liens.”). This permits chapter 13 trustees to begin disbursements expeditiously, as they are encouraged to do by Congress. Id. at 223. The inclusion of this reservation in the form plan is not accidental or vague: it deliberately envisions resolution of the claims objection process post-confirmation. The plan does not purport to allow LVNV's claim or specifically provide for it. It deals with unsecured claims as a class. The plan explicitly reserves the right to object to proofs of claim. The reservation of this category of rights is a permissible reservation, particularly in light of how chapter 13 administration occurs in this district. If LVNV disagreed that the reservation was appropriate, it could have objected to the provision prior to confirmation. It, too, is bound by confirmation. United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U.S. 260, 274, 130 S.Ct. 1367, 176 L.Ed.2d 158 (2010) (holding that a creditor was bound by the terms of the plan despite the fact that the plan should not have been confirmed because the creditor had notice of the plan and did not object). Debtors' objection to LVNV's claim on the basis of the statute of limitations is one recognized by the bankruptcy code. LVNV does not otherwise dispute the objection. The right to object post-confirmation was properly reserved in the plan."
"Can a contempt proceeding for multiple and systemic violations of debtor's discharge injunction be brought as a class proceeding?","IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Debtors' motion [Doc. 59] is GRANTED and the Court directs that Rule 7023 applies to the adjudication of this contested matter, the Debtors' Contempt Motion."
"Does a pre-answer motion to dismiss satisfy the defendant's duty to file an answer?","The Court questions Winchester's argument that a defendant who moves to dismiss only a portion of plaintiff's claims must file an answer on the remaining claims. There is authority which accepts Winchester's position. Gerlach v. Michigan Bell Tel. Co., [Citation omitted] (""Separate counts are, by definition, independent bases for a lawsuit and the parties are responsible to proceed with litigation on those counts which are not challenged by a motion under F.R.C.P. 12(b)""). However, the majority view is that a party does not need to file an answer while a motion to dismiss is pending. Citation omitted]. (collecting cases).

"In the Fifth Circuit, is a guarantor released if the Debtor is the primary obligor and rejects the lease?","502(b) Except as provided in subsections (e)(2), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of this section, if such objection to a claim is made, the court, after notice and a hearing, shall determine the amount of such claim in lawful currency of the United States as of the date of the filing of the petition, and shall allow such claim in such amount, except to the extent that—  (6)  if such claim is the claim of a lessor for damages resulting from the termination of a lease of real property, such claim exceeds—  (A)  the rent reserved by such lease, without acceleration, for the greater of one year, or 15 percent, not to exceed three years, of the remaining term of such lease, following the earlier of—  (i)   the date of the filing of the petition; and  (ii)   the date on which such lessor repossessed, or the lessee surrendered, the leased property; plus  (B)   any unpaid rent due under such lease, without acceleration, on the earlier of such dates;"
"How does the Debtor's rejection of a contract affect a surety to that contract?","A suretyship contract is a tripartite agreement among a principal obligor, his obligee, and a surety. This contract is a direct and original undertaking under which the surety is primarily liable with the principal obligor and therefore is responsible at once if the principal obligor fails to perform.         [Citation omitted]""The liability of a surety is coextensive with that of the principal. The surety is primarily or jointly liable with the principal and, therefore, is immediately responsible if the principal fails to perform."" [Citations omitted]""Ultimate liability rests upon the principal obligor rather than the surety, but the obligee has a remedy against both. The surety, however, becomes subrogated to the rights of the obligee when the surety pays the debt for the principal obligor."" [Citation omitted]."
"How are damages calculated for breach of a ""take or pay"" contract?","In recent years, a few courts have questioned in dicta whether the rule set forth in Section 344 of the First Restatement is still the current rule, in light of the omission of this provision from the Second Restatement. See, e.g., [Citation omitted] (“Even if this is currently the rule—and its absence from the Second Restatement of Contracts suggests that it is not—it does not appear to apply in a case such as this one.”); [Citation omitted]. However, these courts have not expressly rejected the First Restatement rule, but have instead premised their holdings on what Williston describes as “[a]n exception to the general rule,” which “is made if one of the alternatives is to pay a certain sum of money.” [Citations omitted] (holding that the First Restatement rule was inapplicable based on the exception for cases “where an alternative contract provides as one alternative the payment of a sum of money”); [Citation omitted]. This exception provides that “[i]n an alternative contract where one of the alternatives is a sum of money, the promisee is entitled to the sum of money even though the other alternative may be less onerous to the promisor.” [Citation omitted]. Thus, courts which have applied this exception have not needed to determine the continued viability of the general First Restatement rule. We conclude the Nebraska Supreme Court would be most likely to follow the majority approach and award damages based on the alternative that would result in the smaller recovery. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the lesser alternative in this case—the $270,000 total royalty payment—is a fixed sum of money under the “pay” alternative of the take-or-pay contract. An award of damages based on this monetary alternative accordingly complies with the approach taken by several courts, including those which have called the First Restatement rule into question, for an alternative contract that provides as one alternative the payment of a fixed sum of money. We therefore affirm the district court's holding that Z 3 was only entitled to $270,000 in damages for Digital's breach of its obligation to either purchase 12,000 units or pay a $90,000 royalty each year for three years."
"Can the holder of an unliquidated claim serve on a creditors committee?","(b)(1) A committee of creditors appointed under subsection (a) of this section shall ordinarily consist of the persons, willing to serve, that hold the seven largest claims against the debtor of the kinds represented on such committee, or of the members of a committee organized by creditors before the commencement of the case under this chapter, if such committee was fairly chosen and is representative of the different kinds of claims to be represented."
"Can a debtor in bankruptcy sell their car without liability to the debtor in Tennessee?","Because the Antique Cars are property of Debtor's bankruptcy estate and Wolfenbarger did not perfect any lien on the cars under state law, the Court finds that Wolfenbarger holds a mere possessory interest in the Antique Cars that is inferior to the estate's interest and that does not override the Trustee's requirements under 11 U.S.C. § 704(a) to “collect and reduce to money the property of the estate[.]” Until it is abandoned or the case is closed, a debtor's property remains part of the bankruptcy estate, 11 U.S.C. § 554(c), and any entity in possession or control of property of the estate is required to turn it over to the trustee, 11 U.S.C. § 542(a). To prevail in his turnover action, the Trustee must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, “(1) that the property is or was in the possession, custody or control of an entity during the pendency of the case; (2) that the property may be used by the trustee in accordance with § 363 or exempted by the debtor under § 522; and (3) that the property has more than inconsequential value or benefit to the estate. [Citation Omitted]. Each of the foregoing requirements has been satisfied, and the Trustee is entitled to turnover of the Antique Cars from Wolfenbarger. The parties do not dispute that Wolfenbarger is currently in and has had possession of the Antique Cars since 2011, including the entire time the bankruptcy case has been pending. Because the Court has found that the Antique Cars are property of the bankruptcy estate, there is nothing within 11 U.S.C. § 363 or the record that prohibits the Trustee from exercising his statutory authority to “use, sell, or lease” the cars for the benefit of the estate. Furthermore, based on Baker's testimony, the value of classic cars does not depreciate. As a result, they are worth, at a minimum, the $158,370.00 paid for them and are, thus, worth more than an inconsequential value and benefit to the bankruptcy estate. III. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Antique Cars are property of Debtor's bankruptcy estate, that the Trustee holds an interest superior to the possessory interest held by Wolfenbarger, and that the Trustee is entitled to turnover of the cars. Wolfenbarger shall be required to turn over possession of the Antique Cars to the Trustee within thirty days. An Order consistent with this Memorandum will be entered."
"Should the court allow debtor's ""no look"" fee application to be processed depite errors in filing and time charges by an unauthroized second lawyer and an untrained paralegal?","With respect to other services performed by the legal assistants, it is not clear that the services were legal in nature or, more critically, that any of the legal assistants were qualified to perform compensable services. The information contained in the Application simply does not support a finding that any of the legal assistants are qualified paraprofessionals. Moreover, the nature and quality of the work product in this case attributable to the legal assistants does not suggest that any of the legal assistants has either the training or the expertise to perform compensable legal services. Rather, the record strongly suggests that the legal assistants are clerical employees who lack the experience and expertise to perform compensable services. Accordingly, all of their time expended in this case must be considered as law office overhead for which paraprofessional fees cannot be awarded. IV. Conclusion Attorneys are entitled to reasonable compensation for representing debtors before this Court. Eskew, 2012 WL 4866687, at *10. And, to facilitate awarding reasonable fees in Chapter 13 cases, this Court has established a “no look” fee. But, that fee is only available when attorneys provide legal services in a timely and competent manner. When, as here, attorneys waste time and repeatedly file documents which do not meet the minimum requirements for the competent practice of law, the “no look” fee will not be awarded. Id."
"Is a nondischargeable debt for overpayment to debtor of unemployment benefits properly include the filing fee for an adversary proceeding?","A number of courts have held that certifying for unemployment benefits while working full time renders the resulting overpayment nondischargeable under § 523(a)(2)(A), provided fraudulent intent is established. See In re Searle, 2014 WL 1407308, *5–6 (Bankr.D.N.H.2014) (finding that the unemployment benefits paid to the debtor while she was employed full time were nondischargeable where she completed an online certification each week stating that she did not receive any wages or other compensation); In re Sanderson, 509 B.R. 206, 210–211 (Bankr.W.D.Wis.2014) (finding that “the debt owed to the Department representing the actual amount of the overpaid unemployment benefits and accrued interest should be excepted from discharge under section 523(a)(2)(A)” where the debtor continued to accept unemployment benefits after he lost eligibility); In re Platt, 2014 WL 457739 (Bankr.D.Neb.2014) (concluding that the overpayment of unemployment benefits should be excepted from discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A))."
"Was it proper for the court to order a bankruptcy case converted or dismissed for abuse under 11 U.S.C.S. § 707(b)(3) given the totality of debtor's finances?","Under 11 U.S.C. § 707(b), the court is required to dismiss a case (or, if the Debtors consent, convert it) if granting relief under Chapter 7 would be “an abuse”. The application of the means test as set out in 11 U.S.C. § 707(b)(2) determines whether a rebuttable presumption of abuse arises. If the presumption of abuse does not arise under Section 707(b)(2), or if it is rebutted, the court can nevertheless dismiss a Chapter 7 case for abuse if the bankruptcy petition was filed in bad faith or if the totality of the circumstances of the debtor's financial situation demonstrates abuse. See 11 U.S.C. § 707(b)(3). The U.S. Trustee has the burden of proving abuse by a preponderance of the evidence. In re Beckerman, 381 B.R. 841, 844 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.2008)."
"Was it proper for the court to dismiss debtor's Chapter 11 case where Trustee showed that debtor intended to collaterally attack the state court order in a foreclosure case?","From the analysis set forth hereinabove, this court concludes that Debtor held no interests in the property which could be reorganized in this bankruptcy case, at the time that the petition in this case was filed. As the sole purpose of this Chapter 11 case was a further attempt to fend off foreclosure and keep the property for Debtor and Debtor's family, no legitimate purpose exists for this case to continue forward. This case should be dismissed for cause as a result of the lack of legitimate goal and purpose for its existence. In addition, the facts demonstrate both the objective futility of this case, as well as the subjective wrongful intent of the Debtor in filing it. After the failure of Debtor's first case, Debtor improperly filed a case in the name of Debtor's minor son in an attempt to circumvent the bar against refiling imposed by Congress under 11 U.S.C. § 109(g). After the dismissal of that second case and after the foreclosure described above, Debtor has filed this case in an attempt to spring board back into rights no longer held by Debtor. For the reasons set forth in the case of Carolin Corp. v. Miller, 886 F.2d 693 (4th Cir.1989), this case is to be dismissed for reason of Debtor's bad faith. An Order in conformity with this ruling will be entered."
"Does a debtor have to actually receive goods from a creditor in order for that creditor to have an administrative expense claim under 503(b)(9)?","(b) After notice and a hearing, there shall be allowed administrative expenses, other than claims allowed under section 502(f) of this title, including— (9) the value of any goods received by the debtor within 20 days before the date of commencement of a case under this title in which the goods have been sold to the debtor in the ordinary course of such debtor's business."
"Should the court reinstate creditor's late-filed complaint in an adversary proceeding due to excusable neglect where creditor's counsel failed to monitor the court docket resulting in the court granting a motion to strike?","(b)(1) In General. Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, when an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified period by these rules or by a notice given thereunder or by order of Court, the Court for cause shown may at any time in its discretion (1) with or without motion or notice order the period enlarged if the request therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order or (2) on motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect."
"Should the court in a Chapter 11 case reduce or entirely disallow debtor's attorney's fees on the basis of unreasonableness, insufficient descriptions and improper charges?","The Court denies the allowance in part of compensation for the following task since a professional with a lower level of skill and experience or a paraprofessional could have performed the task. [Citation Omitted]. (""Senior partner rates will be paid only for work that warrants the attention of a senior partner. A senior partner who spends time reviewing documents or doing research a beginning associate could do will be paid at a rate of a beginning associate. [Citation omitted].

"Does the bankruptcy court's exercise of a limitation based on the bankruptcy code against debtor's unlimited homestead exemption of non-filing debtor's spouse constitute an unconstitutional taking?","(o)  For purposes of subsection (b)(3)(A), and notwithstanding subsection (a), the value of an interest in—  (1)   real or personal property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a residence;  (2)   a cooperative that owns property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a residence;  (3)   a burial plot for the debtor or a dependent of the debtor; or  (4)   real or personal property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor claims as a homestead;  shall be reduced to the extent that such value is attributable to any portion of any property that the debtor disposed of in the 10-year period ending on the date of the filing of the petition with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor and that the debtor could not exempt, or that portion that the debtor could not exempt, under subsection (b), if on such date the debtor had held the property so disposed of."
"Did the bankruptcy appellate panel commit reversible error by ordering an increase in oversecured creditor's claim for postpetition interest under 11 U.S.C.S. § 506(b)?","As a general matter, unmatured interest is not allowed after the filing of a bankruptcy petition. 11 U.S.C. § 502(b)(2). However, Congress has created an exception to this rule in the case of “oversecured” creditors. See United Sav. Ass'n of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Assocs., 484 U.S. 365, 372–73, 108 S.Ct. 626, 98 L.Ed.2d 740 (1988); Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Dobbins, 35 F.3d 860, 869 (4th Cir.1994). Two provisions of § 506 of the Bankruptcy Code govern the award of post-petition interest to an oversecured creditor. First, § 506(a) sets the amount of a creditor's allowed secured claim: An allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest, ... is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor's interest in the estate's interest in such property,7 ... and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor's interest ... is less than the amount of such allowed claim. Such value shall be determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of such property, and in conjunction with any hearing on such disposition or use or on a plan affecting such creditor's interest. 11 U.S.C. § 506(a)(1).8 Thus, a claim may be bifurcated into secured and unsecured *404 portions depending on the value of the collateral. Next, § 506(b) defines an oversecured creditor's entitlement to post-petition interest: To the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which, after any recovery under subsection (c) of this section, is greater than the amount of such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement or State statute under which such claim arose. Id. § 506(b). Thus, if the collateral is worth more than the amount of the secured claim, the creditor is entitled to post-petition interest on its claim up to the amount of the difference in values (this difference is referred to as an “equity cushion” or “security cushion”). See Baybank–Middlesex v. Ralar Distribs., Inc., 69 F.3d 1200, 1202 (1st Cir.1995) (“A creditor is oversecured when the value of its collateral exceeds the amount of its [allowed secured] claim; postpetition interest and fees are allowable only to the extent of that oversecurity.”); see also Timbers, 484 U.S. at 372, 108 S.Ct. 626 (noting that § 506(b) “permits postpetition interest to be paid only out of the ‘security cushion’ ”). Post-petition interest accrues until the secured claim is paid or until the effective date of the plan. Rake v. Wade, 508 U.S. 464, 468, 113 S.Ct. 2187, 124 L.Ed.2d 424 (1993), superseded by statute on other grounds, 11 U.S.C. § 1322(e)."
"Did the bankruptcy court abuse its discretion by entering an order in dispute over an easement encumbering debtor's estate in a core proceeding?","This Court concurs that Rock Airport and RPP failed to provide credible testimony on this point. Accordingly, there is no conflict—let alone an “improper modification”—to the State Court's July 11, 2008 Consent Order, and thus, the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion by entering the December 3, 2013 Order."
"Did debtor waive his right to object to the bankruptcy court's proposed findings under 28 U.S.C.S. § 157(c) and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9033(d) for failing to file timely objections?","As set forth above, a district court, when “considering the bankruptcy court's proposed findings and conclusions” in a non-core proceeding, reviews “de novo those matters to which any party has timely and specifically objected.” See 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1). The deadline to file an objection and the content that must be included therein are set forth in the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, which provide that “[w]ithin 14 days after being served with a copy of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law a party may serve and file with the clerk written objections which identify the specific proposed findings or conclusions objected to and state the grounds for such objection.” See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9033(b). Consistent therewith, the Civil Local Rules of this District require that “[a]ny objection to the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law” shall include, inter alia, “[t]he issues raised by the objections” and “[t]he specific portion of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law...to which objection is made.” See B.L.R. 9033-1(a). Where a party fails to file objections to proposed findings of fact and conclusions or law, or files objections that do not comply with Rule 9033, the party waives its right to seek de novo review. See Leonard v. Dorsey & Whitney LLP, 553 F.3d 609, 621 (8th Cir. 2009) (holding, “pursuant to Rule 9033(d), [plaintiffs] waived their right to contest the bankruptcy court's dismissal recommendation by failing to object”); In re Nantahala Village, Inc., 976 F.2d 876, 880 (4th Cir. 1992) (holding party who failed to object to bankruptcy judge's recommendation “waived its rights” to appeal district court's order adopting recommendation); Messer v. Peykar Int'l Co., 510 B.R. 31, 38-39 (S.D. N.Y. Bankr. 2014) (holding defendants' motion, which defendants requested district court treat as “objections” to bankruptcy court's recommendation, did not “contain sufficient specificity to qualify as objections” and, consequently, defendants waived right to de novo review of recommendation)."
"Is the two-year lookback period a proper benchmark properly applied to establishing an ordinary course of business defense to avoidance for only 3 transactions in the year prior to the petition date?","The trustee argues the district court erred in considering this two-year period because we “held that the appropriate look-back period is one year” in Lovett, 931 F.2d at 498. This misreads our decision. We ruled only that twelve months preceding the 90–day preference period was “an appropriate standard for determining the ordinary course of business between the parties” in that case. Obviously, when considering this type of fact-intensive issue, what is appropriate in one case is not necessarily appropriate in the next case. The purpose of a look-back period is to evaluate whether challenged transfers “conform to the norm established by the debtor and the creditor in the period before, preferably well before, the preference period.” Tolona, 3 F.3d at 1032. To make a sound comparison, “[n]umerous decisions support the view that the historical baseline should be based on a time frame when the debtor was financially healthy.” Quebecor World (USA), Inc., 491 B.R. 379, 387 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2013) (adopting two-year period), and cases cited. In Lovett, a one year look-back captured 720 invoices paid prior to the 90–day preference period, and 122 invoices paid during that period. 931 F.2d at 498. Here, by contrast, Affiliated Foods and Momar had an established relationship with regular dealings, but there were only nine transactions in the two years prior to the bankruptcy filing. The one-year look-back suggested by the trustee included only three transactions outside the preference period, all occurring at a time when Affiliated Foods was suffering, in the trustee's own words, “severe cash flow problems.” In these circumstances, a two year look-back capturing all nine transactions is a far better benchmark. Surveying these nine transactions, we observe a wide range of payment delays but some recurring patterns. Invoices sent in December and January were paid after consistently longer delays—35–47 days—than invoices in March and April—13 days in 2007 and 26 days for the April 2008 invoice at issue. There were increased delays in mid–2008, consistent with Affiliated Foods' financial distress. Momar's willingness to tolerate those delays was consistent with one purpose of the Bankruptcy Code's preference rules, “to encourage creditors to work with troubled businesses.” In re LGI Energy Solutions, Inc., No. 12–3899, op. at 4, 746 F.3d 350, 353, 2014 WL 1063209 (8th Cir. Mar. 20, 2014). On this record, with a historical average of 35 days between invoice and payment and a range of 13 to 49 days, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that the preferential transfer at issue, a payment made to a regular supplier 26 days after the supplier's invoice, was made “in the ordinary course of business” between debtor Affiliated Foods and transferee Momar. The judgment of the district court is affirmed."
"Did the commencement of a proceeding to dissolve a family trust violate the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C.S. § 362(a)(1) where the estate was the true party in interest?","KGI contends that its adversary action only names Travelers as a defendant, and therefore it is not a lawsuit against a debtor. The Court disagrees with KGI's position. The protection of the automatic stay extends to any action or proceeding against an interest of the debtor. The scope of this protection is not determined solely by whom a party chose to name in the proceeding, but rather, by who is the party with a real interest in the litigation. See e.g. Maaco Enterprises, Inc. v. Corrao, 1991 WL 255132, *2 (E.D.Pa. Nov. 25, 1991) (stating that “[t]he automatic stay provision applies to suits against non-debtor defendants who are related to the debtor and to suits the resolution of which may have a significant impact on the debtor” and finding that suit against Corraos individually was sufficient to invoke protection of § 362 where company formed by individuals was debtor who would be impacted by resolution). In the circumstances of this case, the Court concludes that the Bankruptcy Court correctly recognized that the real party in interest in the Travelers Adversary Action is Kaiser Aluminum."
"Can an attorney's contingency fee for sale of debtor's real property be overturned where the underlying agreement was not approved or ratified by the bankruptcy court?","In the case at bar, the Court believes there are three factors that weigh most heavily in deciding on the Application: the time spent on the services (comprising two of the eighteen factors); the results obtained; and whether the fee is fixed or contingent. Of these three factors one, the time spent on the services weighs heavily against granting the Application because receiving an hourly rate of over $30,000 for under 50 hours of work does shock the conscience of the Court. However, mitigating against that factor is the fact the Market Center agreed to a hybrid fee. Market Center received a great benefit by having a reduced-hourly-fixed fee, and in return agreed to sacrifice some of the upside. When considered as a contingency fee, an award of 15% of the total recovery is eminently reasonable. Finally, the results obtained by Lurie on behalf of Market Center far exceeded expectations. As the Court stated in the Application Opinion: “The fact that the award of compensation and reimbursement to Applicant is $350,752.06 plus some supplemental attorney fees for Applicant's counsel, thus leaving enough to pay all the other creditor in full and put money back into Debtor's pocket, raises the success to the level of rousing.” Application Opinion at 30. With this in mind the Court will determine reasonable compensation for Lurie."
"Is a seller who sold a vehicle to debtor prior to filing but withholds title to the vehicle after filing in violation of the automatic stay?","The Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (the “Summary Judgment Order”) (Adv.Dkt.37)1 was entered by the Court in the above-referenced adversary proceeding (the “Adversary”) on January 6, 2014. In the Summary Judgment Order, the Court found that Billy Ray Smith d/b/a Smith Automotive (“Smith”) willfully violated the automatic stay of 11 U .S.C. § 362(a)(3)2 by withholding from Joseph R. Parker (the “Debtor”) the certificate of title to the Debtor's automobile. The Court ordered Smith to provide the title to the Debtor's automobile within fourteen (14) days of a final judgment and reserved the issue of monetary damages, attorney's fees, and costs for decision at a later hearing."
"Is a debt arising from debtors alleged missappropriation of deferred salary from a trust where debtor had a duty to administer considered nondischargeable?","Defalcation is defined as the “misappropriation of trust funds or money held in any fiduciary capacity; [the] failure to properly account for such funds.” Black's Law Dictionary 417 (6th ed. 1990). Under section 523(a)(4), defalcation “includes the innocent default of a fiduciary who fails to account fully for money received.” In re Short, 818 F.2d at 694 (citation omitted); In re Baird, 114 B.R. 198, 204 (9th Cir. BAP 1990) (“In the context of section 523(a)(4), the term ‘defalcation’ includes innocent, as well as intentional or negligent defaults so as to reach the conduct of all fiduciaries who were short in their accounts”). To the extent In re Martin, 161 B.R. 672, 678 (9th Cir. BAP 1993), conflicts with this standard, it is overruled. An individual may be liable for defalcation without having the intent to defraud."
"Is a bankruptcy trustee entitled to hire counsel from his own law firm under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2014(a)?","In addition to the requirements under § 327 regarding disinterestedness and holding no adverse interests, Rule 2014 sets forth additional requirements for a proper employment application. First, the application must state why the employment is necessary. Fed. R. Bankr. P.2014(a). This requirement can be met by a simple statement to the effect of, “I need a __ (lawyer, accountant, etc.) because ____________________ (the reason).” Exhaustive, hypothetical lists do not meet the requirement and are generally a poor substitute for direct statements."
"Is debtor's counsel entitled to additional attorney fees where counsel prosecuted a prepetition court action on behalf of debtor?","Ateco, Inc (“Debtor”) was a manufacturer of attachments for heavy equipment machinery, once shipping its proprietary products around the U.S. and the globe. Its journey to vindicate a relatively simple breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets and licensing agreement dispute should have been a straightforward, well defined path through the California state courts, ending in a speedy resolution allowing the company to return its focus to machinery research and development rather than litigation. Because Ateco initially hired John Hebb to litigate a trademark infringement dispute, Ateco's odyssey has instead come to look more like Joseph K.'s strange trip through the legal system in Franz Kafka's The Trial rather than any appropriate dispute resolution in the American justice system. Just as Joseph K. never really knew why he had been arrested, Ateco has been incapable of resolving a simple fee dispute for almost 10 years. After lengthy trips through two California Superior Court actions, a California appellate action, a bankruptcy case, three separate appeals to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and, lastly, this trial, Hebb has never presented a coherent theory for why Ateco owes him any further attorney fees. This lengthy memorandum, combined with previous rulings in the case, detail the alternative reality forced on Ateco and this Court by the constant stream of baseless legal pleadings produced by claimant Hebb."
"Did debtor commit fiduciary defalcation by allowing his bank officer spouse to access and handle trust funds, resulting in spouse diverting the funds for her own personal use?","Even assuming that Gerald had proven that Cherie acted knowingly or with gross recklessness with respect to her actions in diverting and misusing the trust funds, he has not provided sufficient facts to permit the court to impute her intent or gross recklessness to Bobby. “Where no agency relationship exists, the courts have not generally imputed the wrongdoing of a nondebtor spouse to a debtor in holding a debt nondischargeable.” Tsurukawa v. Nikon Precision, Inc. (In re Tsurukawa), 258 B.R. 192, 198 (9th Cir. BAP 2001). “[A] marital union alone, without a finding of a partnership or other agency relationship between spouses, cannot serve as a basis for imputing fraud from one spouse to the other.” Id. Even if an agency relationship existed between Bobby and Cherie, moreover, the court concludes that any wrongful intent on Cherie's part cannot be imputed vicariously to Bobby. Consistent with Bullock, Bobby's mental state must have been shown to be culpable with respect to Cherie's actions, whether by his knowledge and acquiescence in her conduct or by his gross recklessness as to a “substantial and unjustifiable risk” that her actions would violate his fiduciary duties. Bullock, 133 S.Ct. at 1757, 1759. Further, the bankruptcy appellate panel has recently held that the wrongful intent of an agent is not chargeable to the principal unless the principal knew or should have known of the agent's improper acts. See Sachan v. Huh (In re Huh), 506 B.R. 257, 271–72 (9th Cir. BAP 2014) (“While the principal/debtor need not have participated actively in the fraud for the creditor to obtain an exception to discharge, the creditor must show that the debtor knew, or should have known, of the agent's fraud.”). This court does not resolve whether a principal may be chargeable with the wrongful intent of an agent when the principal “should have known” of the agent's conduct or whether such a standard is consistent with the mental state that Bullock requires for a fiduciary to commit defalcation. Gerald has offered no evidence to show that Bobby either knew or should have known of Cherie's actions. CONCLUSION For each of these reasons, plaintiff Gerald Maxwell has not sustained his burden on the element of wrongful intent as to his defalcation theory. Since the showing of intent for fraud under § 523(a)(4) is at least as rigorous as that required for defalcation, see Bullock, 133 S.Ct. at 1757, Gerald has also not sustained his burden to show Bobby's fraud while acting in a fiduciary capacity, see 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4). Judgment shall be entered in favor of Bobby. Counsel for Bobby shall prepare and lodge a judgment consistent with the findings herein."
"On what basis should the court grant or deny the Chapter 7 trustee's motion to exempt debtor's remainder interest in real property from abandonment under 11 U.S.C.S. § 554(c)?","For precisely these reasons, any exception will be rare. It may be justified when the following circumstances are present: (1) A reasonable possibility must exist that an asset valuable enough to pay substantial dividends to the creditors may be recovered in the future. A potential recovery of minimal value to the creditors would not be sufficient reason to except a claim from abandonment. (2) The event that will trigger the reopening of the case for distribution of that asset must be well-defined. It should not require any further action by any representative of the estate, for if action is required, then the Chapter 7 Trustee should not be discharged until the necessary steps are completed. (3) The events that may result in payment to the estate must not be likely to occur soon, for if the asset was expected to be liquidated within say, a year, the case should probably be kept open until then."
"Did Chapter 13 debtor improperly claim an older vehicle expense as part of his projected disposable income where there was non-compliance with the IRS standards?","Section 1325(b)(1) provides that upon objection by the trustee or the holder of an allowed, unsecured claim, the plan may not be confirmed unless the debtor pays all unsecured claims in full or the plan proposes to pay all the debtor's projected disposable income for the applicable commitment period to unsecured creditors. Because each of the Debtors is above the applicable median income for a family of similar size in the state of Missouri, their disposable income is calculated in accordance with § 1325(b)(3) which incorporates the provisions of § 707(b)(2). In turn, that paragraph incorporates the standards promulgated by the IRS for assessing the ability of delinquent taxpayers to pay taxes owed to the government. The Local Standards component of the IRS standards includes ownership as well as operating expense deductions for debtors. The allowances for operating expenses are contained in tables which yield the appropriate number for the deduction based on the number of vehicles owned by the debtor and the region in which the debtor lives. In addition to these standards, the IRS has published a manual which contains guidance for its agents in interpreting and applying the standards, the relevant portion of which is quoted above."
"Can a vendor demand payment before performing post-petition?","The pre-plan post-petition payment is voidable by the debtor-in-possession. “[T]he trustee may avoid a transfer of property of the estate that occurs after the commencement of the case and that is not authorized under this title or by the court.” 11 U.S.C. § 549(a). The payment is not authorized by the Code, nor is it authorized by this Court. If the trustee seeks to avoid this transfer, H.D. Smith may be liable on the transfer. See 11 U.S.C. § 550. The avoidance powers of the trustee are limited by § 546. H.D. Smith may have been entitled to reclamation of such goods sold to the Debtor within 45 days of commencement of the case. 11 U.S.C. § 546(c). “If the seller of goods fails to provide notice ..., the seller still may assert the rights contained in section 503(b)(9).” Id. H.D. Smith's possible reliance on the belief that it would receive its entire pre-petition debt as a critical vendor could have led it not to have filed for reclamation of those goods. Since H.D. Smith is not a critical vendor, it will be allowed the opportunity to amend its claim as an administrative expense to the extent of “the value of any goods received by the debtor within 20 days before the date of commencement of a case under this title in which the goods have been sold to the debtor in the ordinary course of such debtor's business.” 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(9). This amended claim will be subject to the objection of parties in interest."
"Is a vendor entitled to pre-payment before performing an executory contract post-petition?","Clearly, Just For Feet cannot survive unless it has name brand sneakers and athletic apparel to sell in its stores. The Debtors need a continuous supply of inventory from athletic footwear and apparel vendors such as Nike, New Balance, Fila, Reebok, Adidas, Asics, K–Swiss and Converse. Rockey testified that without new merchandise from these vendors, Just For Feet will not survive. Therefore, the court finds that payment of the pre-petition claims of certain trade vendors—the athletic footwear and apparel vendors—is essential to the survival of the debtor during the chapter 11 reorganization. With regard to other trade vendors that the motion may contemplate paying, the Debtors have not shown that payment of the pre-petition claims of other vendors is critical to Just For Feet's survival in reorganization. The court invites the Debtors to renew the motion and present additional evidence with respect to other trade vendors, but absent such a showing, the court will not grant the Debtors' motion with respect to these other vendors. The court notes that the expedited nature of these proceedings may have limited the evidentiary showing on this motion. With Thanksgiving less than two weeks away, the Debtors need to resolve this issue quickly to replenish the inventory in their stores for the upcoming holiday shopping season. With this context in mind, and in light of the evidence presented, the court grants the Debtors' motion to pay the pre-petition claims of trade vendors only with respect to athletic footwear and apparel vendors. The Debtors are authorized and directed to pay the pre-petition claims of athletic footwear and apparel vendors as they become due, in exchange for the vendors' written agreement to extend credit to the Debtors on similar or better terms than the Debtors have enjoyed in the past. The court retains exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising out of these written agreements with athletic footwear and apparel vendors. The court will enter an order in accordance with this opinion."
"What is the standard for moving for relief from stay to terminate a contract?","In pertinent part, § 362(d)(1) of the bankruptcy code provides that “... the court shall grant relief from the stay ... -(1) for cause ...” 11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(1). Although the debtor has the burden of proof on the issue of cause, see § 362(g), that obligation is predicated on Colonial's duty to make a cognizable “initial showing”: Neither the statute nor the legislative history defines the term ‘for cause’ ... The burden is on the moving party to make an initial showing of ‘cause’ for relief from the stay. Only if the movant makes such a showing does any burden shift to the debtor; absent a showing of cause, the court should simply deny relief from the stay. In re Mazzeo, 167 F.3d 139, 142 (2d Cir.1999) (internal citations omitted)."
"Under what circumstances will the court set a deadline to assume or reject of a contract under Section 365(d)?","The State contends that it would be deprived of protections under § 365(d)(2) if Debtor's motion to assume and assign its lease is granted. Section 365(d)(2) provides: In a case under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13 of this title, the trustee may assume or reject an executory contract or unexpired lease of residential real property or of personal property of the debtor at any time before the confirmation of a plan but the court, on request of any party to such contract or lease, may order the trustee to determine within a specified period of time whether to assume or reject such contract or lease. 11 U.S.C. § 365(d)(2) (emphasis added)."
"What is an interest in property entitled to protection under 11 usc 363(e)?","In a hearing regarding a § 363(f) free-and-clear sale, § 363(p) provides that “the entity asserting an interest in property has the burden of proof on the issue of the validity, priority, or extent of such interest.” 11 U.S.C. § 363(p)(2). To satisfy this burden, the party asserting the interest must prove two things: “First, as a preliminary matter, the party must prove that it holds a perfected security interest in post-petition revenues to which its liens still rightly attach. Second, a party must prove the amount of money to which its liens attach.” Chequers Inv. Assocs. v. Hotel Sierra Vista Ltd. P'ship (In re Hotel Sierra Vista Ltd. P'ship), 112 F.3d 429, 434 (9th Cir.1997) (citations omitted). Accordingly, it is BOH's burden to prove the value of its interest."
"Is the undue hardship standard under section 523(a)(8) the same for publicly and privately funded student loans?","A. First Prong of Brunner Test: Present Inability to Pay No one quibbles with the assertion that with only $31.00 each month in disposable income, Dr. Warner could not possibly pay the $1,700.00 monthly payment necessary to service his private student loan debt and maintain a “minimal” standard of living. By his credible testimony, corroborated by his budget (Exh. 2) which the court admitted without objection, Dr. Warner lives a “frugal” existence, devoid of vacations and retirement savings. He drives a high mileage vehicle of modest make. According to his budget, it appears that he is unable to save towards a down payment for a replacement if, or more likely when, the vehicle ceases functioning. Because the first prong of the Brunner test is concerned only with a debtor's present inability to pay while maintaining a modest or “minimal” standard of living, and because Dr. Warner's present income is barely enough to cover his living expenses in Chicago as matters presently stand, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Warner has met his burden on this element of the Brunner test."
"Is a bankruptcy trustee estopped from taking positions contrary to those taken by the debtor prior to the appointment of the trustee?","The court will first address Knight's and Bridge's judicial estoppel argument. A party “who assumes one position in its pleadings is estopped from asserting a contrary position in a subsequent proceeding if: (1) the position of the party to be estopped is clearly inconsistent with its previous one; (2) the party convinced the court in the previous proceeding to accept its position; and (3) the party asserted the prior position intentionally rather than inadvertently.” In re Miller, 347 B.R. 48, 54 (Bankr.S.D.Tex.2006). Applying these elements to the present case, the contents of the pleadings judicially noticed from AIPC's bankruptcy case cannot estop the Trustee from asserting the alter ego doctrine. In Miller, the court addressed whether the debtor's failure to disclose a cause of action in his schedules estopped the trustee from pursuing those claims. The court concluded that judicial estoppel did not apply to the trustee because the trustee never took a “contrary position”: [J]udicial estoppel might apply to Debtor. But the party seeking to reopen this bankruptcy case is the Trustee, and the Trustee did not make the statement about which Merck complains. The Trustee did not file the schedules. The Trustee is not judicially estopped from reopening this case by a “contrary position” by the Debtor. In short, the Court cannot see any “contrary position” that the Trustee may have taken. 347 B.R. at 54. The same reasoning applies to the present case. Given that the Trust was not created and the Trustee was not appointed until confirmation, the Trustee cannot be charged with any of the positions taken in the pleadings filed by the Debtor prior to confirmation. See In re Broussard, 351 B.R. 383, 387–88 (Bankr.W.D.La.2006); In re Knippers, No. 00–12491, 2004 WL 3244581 at *5–6 (Bankr.M.D.La. Sept.29, 2004). To the extent that Bridge and Knight seek to “impute” the representations in pre-confirmation filings to the Trustee, nothing in the case law on judicial estoppel supports this broad application of the doctrine. See, e.g., In re Quarles, No. 06–CV–0137–CVE–SAJ, 2007 WL 171913 at *6–7 (N.D.Okla. Jan.18, 2007) (affirming bankruptcy court's ruling that knowledge and conduct of debtor could not be imputed to the trustee for purposes of applying judicial estoppel). Nor would the court be inclined to apply the doctrine in such a way that the pre-appointment conduct of the debtor could be used to unduly limit the ability of an appointed bankruptcy trustee to administer the estate."
"Can a bankruptcy trustee use a rule 60 motion to attack a decision made prior to her appointment?","“[R]elief under Rule 60(b) is ‘circumscribed by public policy favoring finality of judgments and termination of litigation.’ ” Blue Diamond Coal Co., 249 F.3d at 524 (quoting Waifersong Ltd. v. Classic Music Vending, 976 F.2d 290, 292 (6th Cir.1992)). “This is especially true in an application of subsection (6) of Rule 60(b), which applies ‘only in exceptional or extraordinary circumstances which are not addressed by the first five numbered clauses of the Rule.’ ” Id.

"When a fraudulent transfer claim is based on the transfer of stock how does the court determine the location of the transfer?","Defendant only challenges ASARCO's fraudulent transfer claim under Rule 12(b)(6) as a standing challenge, arguing as a matter of law that ASARCO cannot pierce the corporate veil of SPH, which actually owned the stock. The parties both agree that Delaware law should govern whether ASARCO can pierce the corporate veil in order to assert its standing. (Transcript of Mot. Hr'g. at 6:17–18; 33:1–2, July 13, 2007); (see Compendium of Additional Cases Supporting ASARCO and SPH's Resp. to AMC's Mot. To Dismiss the First Am. Compl. Vols. 1, 2; AMC's Memo. In Resp. to Supp. Materials; ASARCO and SPH's Reply to AMC's Memorandum Dated August 9, 2007.) The issue of whether ASARCO is the proper party to assert these claims involves the intersection of two legal issues that the Court must decide: (1) the substantive fraudulent transfer claim and (2) the veil piercing claim. Texas choice-of-law rules are distinct and separate regarding how to determine the appropriate substantive law to determine these two issues. This Court first addresses which substantive law should govern the fraudulent transfer claim as a whole and then examines which substantive law governs the veil piercing issue. 1. Fraudulent Transfer Choice-of-law Rules Defendant contests ASARCO's standing to assert a fraudulent transfer  claim. A claim for fraudulent transfer arises in tort. In re Tex. Am. Express, Inc., 190 S.W.3d 720, 725 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, no pet.) (citing Tex. Bus & Com.Code Ann. § 24.005 (Vernon 2002)); Blackthorne v. Bellush, 61 S.W.3d 439, 443–444 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2001, no pet.); Warfield, 2007 WL 1112591, at *7 (resolving the issue for purposes of Texas choice-of-law rules). Texas choice-of-law rules for causes of action in tort apply section 145 of the Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws, also described as the “most significant relationship test.” Duncan v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 665 S.W.2d 414, 420–21 (Tex.1984); Vasquez v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 325 F.3d 665, 674 (5th Cir.2003). According to section 145, the local law of the state which has the “most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties” will govern the claim. Duncan, 665 S.W.2d at 421 (adopting Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws § 145(1) (1971)). In applying the Restatement's “most significant relationship test”, this Court considers the following factors: (1) the place where the injury occurred; (2) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred; (3) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties; and (4) the place where the relationship between the parties is centered. Enigma Holdings, Inc. v. Gemplus Int'l S.A., No. 3:05–cv–1168–B, 2006 WL 2859369, at *7 (N.D.Tex. Oct.6, 2006); Warfield, 2007 WL 1112591, at *7; Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws § 145 (1971). When weighing these four factors, it is not the number of contacts, but the qualitative nature of those particular contacts that determines which state has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties. Duncan, 665 S.W.2d at 421; Ford Motor Co. v. Aguiniga, 9 S.W.3d 252, 260 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1999, pet. denied)."
"Under what conditions can a creditor object to the trustee abandoning property?","Although the traditional constitutional requirements represent the mandatory minimum requirements for a party to have standing, Congress can “modify or even abrogate prudential standing requirements, thus extending standing to the full extent permitted by Article III.” St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 579 F.3d at 539 (quoting another source). In Rule 6007 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (“Rule 6007”), Congress has extended standing to the full extent permitted by Article III by allowing any “party-in-interest” to object to a proposed abandonment of property. See In re C–Power Prods., Inc., 230 B.R. 800, 804 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1998). Therefore, in lieu of prudential “bankruptcy standing” requirements, the Debtor must satisfy the statutory “party-in-interest” requirement. The term “party-in-interest” appears in many different sections of the Bankruptcy Code but is not defined in § 101. The legislative history suggests the term intentionally was omitted from the list of definitions in § 101 to allow some flexibility in its use. See In re N. Am. Oil & Gas, Inc., 130 B.R. 473, 479 (Bankr.W.D.Tex.1990), abrogated on other grounds by Pritchard v. U.S. Trustee (In re England), 153 F.3d 232 (5th Cir.1998). Specifically, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has broadly interpreted the term to include any creditor of the debtor “as well as any other person with a sufficient stake in [the] outcome of a [bankruptcy] proceeding so as to require representation.” Int'l Transactions, Ltd. v. Embotelladora Agral Regiomontana, S.A. de C.V., 347 F.3d 589, 595 (5th Cir.2003); see also Johnson v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co., No. 3:12–CV–3542–L, 2013 WL 3810715, at *6 (N.D.Tex.2013); In re Presto, 376 B.R. 554, 564 (Bankr.S.D.Tex.2007). The outcome of the current proceeding before the Court (whether the Trustee may abandon the Subject Property) hinges on whether the Trustee has a duty to ensure that the Subject Property owned by the Debtor is remediated. If the Trustee were not allowed to abandon the Subject Property because of environmental concerns, the Trustee may then have additional duties in relation to the Debtor's Subject Property. In addition, if the abandonment were not approved, the proposed settlements of the Related Proceedings would be withdrawn, and the proceedings seeking the remediation of the Subject Property would continue. For these reasons, the Court finds that the Debtor has a sufficient stake in the outcome of this proceeding, and, thus, she is a “party-in-interest” who has standing under Rule 6007. Although case law addressing analogous facts is scant, the Court's determination on the standing issue is in line with the analysis provided by a prominent bankruptcy treatise on the subject. See 10 Collier On Bankruptcy ¶ 6007.04 n.1 (16th ed. 2015) (“[O]wners of property affected by the abandonment should have standing to bring ... environmental issues to the court's attention”). Having determined that the Debtor has standing to object to the Notice of Abandonment, the Court will now turn to the merits of the Notice of Abandonment and the Objection to Abandonment."
"Can a defendant assert that he was a mere conduit as an affirmative defense in a preference action?","The parties spill a great deal of ink debating whether the Participants are initial or subsequent transferees, but the issue is immaterial on this motion. For the Participants to be liable to Sterling, Sterling must be liable to the estate, and for that to occur, I must conclude that all of the elements of a preferential transfer are present and the affirmative defenses fail, including the defense that Sterling was a mere conduit. In other words, unless I find that Sterling was an initial transferee, the third party claims become moot. (See Answer ¶¶ 54, 61)(pleading Sterling's hypothetical liability to the plaintiff as an element of its indemnity claims.) Accordingly, I must assume that Sterling is liable as an initial transferee in determining the sufficiency of the third party claims."
"Does a creditors claim decrease if they are paid post-petition?","While a majority trend is developing, there remains a split among the courts as to the appropriate allocation of postpetition payments to an undersecured creditor with a secured interest in both real property and postpetition revenues. As Judge Saris described in Beal Bank, S.S.B. v. Waters Edge Limited Partnership: The Maginot line is clearly drawn. The “subtraction” cases hold that post-petition rent payments to the undersecured creditor should be subtracted from the secured portion of the creditor's claim as measured by the value of the real estate. Conversely, the “addition” cases hold that the amount of post-petition rents not reinvested into real estate should be added to the size of the creditor's secured claim, and that payment of those rents decreases the total amount of the creditor's claim but not the secured portion of its claim as measured by the value of the real estate. 248 B.R. 668, 685 (D.Mass.2000). Judge Saris ultimately adopted the “addition” approach, id. at 686, and this Court agrees with that conclusion."
"Does section 546(e) insulate private LBO's from avoidance if the sale proceeds are paid through a bank","Given the plain language of the statute, the circuit courts' agreement that it should be construed broadly, and the Second Circuit's decision in Enron, the Court determines that the payments made in exchange for the Silvas' stock were settlement payments and are protected from avoidance by Section 546(e)."
"Can the court bar third party opt-in plaintiffs in a FLSA class action from pursuing their claims for failure to make proper disclosures in their bankruptcy cases?","In this case, the Plaintiffs must have had knowledge of their FLSA claims because they signed the opt-in forms to become Plaintiffs in this case. (Doc. 283, Exhibits 6, 7, 8, 10, 12). Furthermore, the Plaintiffs did have motive to conceal their participation in this lawsuit; an asset—even a contingent asset—could be used to satisfy the debtor's obligations to creditors under the bankruptcy discharge. By failing to report their participation in the lawsuit, Plaintiffs had the opportunity to keep any funds they received as part of the lawsuit for themselves. Intent can also be inferred by the facts that two of the five had filed for bankruptcy before and all five were represented by lawyers in their bankruptcy cases, indicating that the failure to disclose was not a simple oversight by an inexperienced, pro se plaintiff."
"Should a breakup fee claimed by debtor-in-possession lender initially denied by the Chapter 11 bankruptcy court be subsequently allowed as an administrative expense claim?","It could be argued that by holding its offer to provide post-petition lending open until the Court entered a final order approving the post-petition loan facility with U.S. Bank, Sunstone provided consideration to the DIP. That may be so, but that in itself is not the “direct and substantial” benefit to the estate that would transform a pre-petition contingent claim to an administrative expense claim. There is no evidence that providing an alternate, if costly, loan facility should the Court not enter a final order approving the Bank financing provided more than an incidental benefit to the estate. The Bank indicated a willingness to make changes post-petition in order to allow entry of a final order, as evidenced by the changes it made in negotiations with the Unsecured Creditors' Committee. Any benefit provided by Sunstone, if any, was too indirect and intangible to qualify for priority treatment."
"Does a foreclosure judgment create a judicial lien where the bankruptcy court is collaterally estopped from deciding whether that lien can be avoided?","Webster does not dispute that the Deficiency Liens are “judicial liens”, or that the Debtors' $30,001.00 exemption claim in the Liened Property was “an exemption to which the[y] ... would have been entitled”, within the meaning of Section 522(f). Nonetheless, Webster insists that because the Deficiency Liens had their origin in a deficiency judgment arising within a mortgage foreclosure action, they are immunized from avoidance by Section 522(f)(2)(C). Accordingly, whether the Deficiency Liens are tantamount to a “judgment arising out of a mortgage foreclosure” within the meaning of Section 522(f)(2)(C), and thereby qualify for exclusion from the universe of avoidable judicial liens, is the dispositive issue in this contested matter (hereafter, the “Exclusion Issue”)."
"Can the court properly avoid a lien against debtor's farm property to the extent that it claimed a security interest in acres not included in the original lien?","Here, the Corrected Mortgage was an altered copy of the 2006 Mortgage. The Corrected Mortgage was not signed by the parties, and accordingly the Corrected Mortgage did not contain notarized signatures. The signatures on the Corrected Mortgage were obtained in 2006, not in 2009 when the Corrected Mortgage was filed. The Corrected Mortgage may not be “considered of record,” even though it was entered by the clerk. The New Mexico recording act therefore precludes a finding that recording the Corrected Mortgage gave constructive notice of AGNM's interest in the Additional 220 Acre parcel as required to remove the mortgage lien from the strong-arm powers of § 544(a)(3). New Mexico case law confirms that an unacknowledged writing affecting title to real property, even though recorded, does not provide constructive notice. The rule has been applied to a deed which was altered after its acknowledgment, an executory contract for the sale of real property, and materialmen's liens. An unacknowledged chattel mortgage also provides no constructive notice of its contents."
"Should trustee's motion to revoke discharge be granted where trustee learned of debtor's fraud after the time period in Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4004 (a) to object had passed but before discharge was granted?","In this case, the discharge was entered on June 11, 2010. However, the deadline for the Trustee or creditors to object to discharge ran on June 1, 2010. As of June 1, 2010, the Trustee had yet to learn of the existence of Richard Meabon's interest in a trust. It is unclear when exactly the Trustee learned of the trust, but both parties agree that it was after June 1, 2010 and likely before June 11, 2010. Since the Trustee had no knowledge of the trust prior to the discharge objection bar date, his action is not precluded."
"Is an equity release substantial contribution for purposes of a third party release?","Although claims for actual fraudulent transfers and constructive fraudulent transfers both derive from  548 of the Bankruptcy Code, some courts apply a different pleading standard to the two types of claims. Some courts have found that allegations of an actual fraudulent transfer must satisfy the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b); whereas, allegations of a constructive fraudulent transfer need only satisfy the notice pleading standard of Rule 8(a). See, e.g., Geltzer v. Barish (In re Geltzer), 502 B.R. 760, 766 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2013); In re Petters Co., Inc., 495 B.R. 887, 91617 (Bankr.D.Minn.2013); AstroPower Liquidating Trust v. Xantrex Tech., Inc. (In re AstroPower Liquidating Trust), 335 B.R. 309, 333 (Bankr.D.Del.2005). This distinction has been made by these courts because an actual fraudulent transfer claim under  548(a)(1)(A) is based on the actual intent to defraud creditors; in contrast to a constructive fraudulent transfer claim under  548(a)(1)(B) which is based on the debtor's financial condition and the sufficiency of the consideration (not actual fraud). See Petters, 495 B.R. at 917; Geltzer, 502 B.R. at 766. The Fifth Circuit, however, has not definitively answered the question regarding which pleading standard to apply to fraudulent transfer claims. See Janvey v. Alguire, 647 F.3d 585, 599 (5th Cir.2011) (declining to address the issue); see also Paradigm Air Carriers, Inc. v. Texas Rangers Baseball Partners (In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners), 498 B.R. 679, 71112 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.2013) (declining to decide the issue, but finding that Rule 9(b) standard was met in any event). Out of an abundance of caution, this Court will apply the Rule 9(b) pleading standard (requiring particularity) to Plaintiff Trust's actual fraudulent transfer claims, and will apply the Rule 8(a) (notice standard) to Plaintiff Trust's constructive fraudulent transfer claims."
"Is a stalking horse bidder entitled to protections if it has unclean hands?","Plaintiff claims that Defendant failed to conduct proper email searches, as evidenced by emails in Plaintiff's possession that were not uncovered in Defendant's search. Dkt. 45, at 13. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant should demonstrate that it has done a diligent search and that Defendant should conduct additional searches using terms requested by Plaintiff. Plaintiff requests that these new searches be conducted without including Plaintiff's first or last name, and that they should be conducted on the email accounts of each witness.  Defendant claims that it has already reviewed 21,000 emails from 17 custodians, at a cost of $48,074; that the emails Plaintiff claims Defendant should have uncovered were from 2012 and likely deleted by the account holders due to passage of time; that it has produced all formal complaints similar to Plaintiff's that occurred at the same store during the relevant time period; and that it conducted searches, file reviews, and interviews to uncover similar informal complaints. Dkt. 60, at 18. Defendant asserts that a search using the 88 new search terms - which include annoy*, bull, click*, dad, date*, hand, rack, rod, box - in conjunction with removing Plaintiff's name from the search would result in hundreds of thousands of irrelevant emails. Plaintiff's request for email searches is overly broad and not proportional to the case. Plaintiff refers to a multi-plaintiff case to support her assertion that Defendant should conduct searches without using Plaintiff's name. Dkt. 45, at 15. Searching without the use of Plaintiff's name would not be proportional in this single-plaintiff case. While the additional search terms could possibly yield some relevant results, Plaintiff has not provided specifics about what Plaintiff reasonably expects such a search to show, and Plaintiff has not shown that this information could not be found through other means. For example, Plaintiff has not shown that she would be unable to uncover the same information by asking additional questions of witnesses already scheduled to be deposed. As to this discovery issue, Plaintiff's motion should be denied."
"Can a creditor be sanctioned by the bankruptcy court for intentional infliction of emotional distress damages caused by violation of discharge injunction?","Emotional distress constitutes actual damages. In re Nibbelink, 403 B.R. 113, 120–21 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2009). Emotional distress is expected to occur where the conduct is egregious or extreme. Id. at 120. Significant emotional distress is readily apparent where the conduct is egregious and corroborating medical evidence is not required. Dawson v. Washington Mut. Bank, F.A. (In re Dawson), 390 F.3d 1139, 1150 (9th Cir.2004). Entitlement to emotional distress damages exists “even in the absence of an egregious violation, if the individual in fact suffered significant emotional harm and the circumstances surrounding the violation make it obvious that a reasonable person would suffer significant emotional harm.” Id. at 1151. The Debtor's emotional distress is readily apparent due to Aurora's intentional, egregious, and extreme conduct. He is not required to present corroborating medical evidence. In re Nibbelink, 403 B.R. at 120; In re Dawson, 390 F.3d at 1150–51. The Debtor is entitled to actual damages for significant emotional distress, aggravation, and inconvenience in the amount of $100.00 per telephone call, for a total award of $4,400.00 for actual damages for emotional distress."
"Can debtor's discharge be denied pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 727(a)(4)(A) where debtor submitted false oaths on the means test with fraudulent intent?","The Bankruptcy Court concluded that Rossi established that the debtors intentionally made a false oath by a preponderance of the evidence and that the debtors failed to provide credible justifications for their erroneous and misleading statements in the Schedules and Amended Means Test. Sept. 10 Mem. & Order, at 16. As set forth below, the Bankruptcy Court did not err in finding that the debtors made the inaccurate statements and omissions with the intent to deceive, or a reckless indifference to the truth. As it regards a question of fact, this determination is reviewed for clear error, with deference given to the Bankruptcy Court's opportunity to judge the credibility of the debtors and any other witnesses. See U.S. Lines, Inc. v. Am. Steamship Owners Mut. Prot. & Indem. Ass'n, Inc. (In re U.S. Lines, Inc.), 197 F.3d 631, 640–41 (2d Cir.1999). This Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the reasoned conclusion by the Bankruptcy Court."
"Is the successor personal representative for debtor's deceased mother's estate entitled to relief from stay under 11 U.S.C.S. § 362 to file state court actions against the debtor?","The term “cause” is not defined by the Bankruptcy Code. Courts are directed to make this determination on a case by case basis. In re Benalcazar, 283 B.R. 514, 535–536 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.2002). The Seventh Circuit has adopted a three-part balancing test to determine whether cause exists to lift the stay: 1) whether any great prejudice to either the bankrupt estate or the debtor will result from continuation of the civil suit; 2) whether the hardship to the [non-bankruptcy party] by maintenance of the stay considerably outweighs the hardship of the debtor and 3) whether the creditor has a probability of prevailing on the merits. In re Fernstrom, 938 F.2d 731, 735 (7th Cir.1991)."
"Is the creditor landlord entitled to an administrative expense claim for post-petition, pre-rejection rent on nonresidential real property?","We agree with the majority of courts which conclude that Section 365(d)(3) provides administrative expense status to post-petition, pre-rejection claims under leases of non-residential real property. Section 503(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code provides for the allowance of administrative expenses including the actual necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate and certain taxes and related penalties and fines. 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(1). In order to obtain administrative expense status under Section 503(b)(1), a claimant must demonstrate that its claim was an actual and necessary cost or expense of preserving the bankruptcy estate. This test generally requires proof of a benefit to the bankruptcy estate. Section 365(d)(3) excludes post-petition, pre-rejection obligations under leases of nonresidential real property from the cost-benefit analysis used to determine if an expense is an actual necessary cost or expense of preserving the debtor's bankruptcy estate and instead guarantees payment of post-petition, pre-rejection obligations regardless of any benefit to the debtor or its estate. In re At Home Corp., 392 F.3d at 1068–69. To hold that Section 365(d)(3) does not confer administrative expense status to post-petition, pre-rejection claims would defeat the spirit and letter of Section 365(d)(3): post-petition, pre-rejection claims must be paid when due."
"Can a debtor claim an exemption in a vehicle owned by debtor spouse but where debtor claimed ownership through a resulting trust?","The Debtors stated under oath on their originally-filed schedules that the Honda was owned by Dylan. The Debtors repeated that assertion, under oath, in their testimony at the Section 341 meeting. “[T]he Debtor did not list her ‘trust’ interest in the Property in the Schedules which were signed under penalty of perjury.”  In re Cantrell, 270 B.R. 551, 557 (Bankr.D.Conn.2001) (finding no resulting trust where the debtor did not claim the existence of a resulting trust until after the meeting of creditors); cf. Davenport v. S.I. Securities (In re Davenport), 268 B.R. 159, 162 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.2001) (resulting trust found when, among other things, the debtor's original “bankruptcy schedules showed an equitable interest in the property”). The presumption of a gift, from Laura to Dylan, has not been overcome. The Debtors have not proven that their intention at the time of the transfer was for Dylan to hold the Honda in trust for Laura, nor have they adequately shown that Dylan acquiesced to the creation of any such trust. IV. CONCLUSION This Court finds and rules that Dylan owned both the Truck and the Honda on the date this case commenced and he did not hold the Honda in a resulting trust in favor of Laura. Since he is afforded an exemption in only one vehicle under § 522(d)(2) and the exemption available under § 522(d)(5) has been allocated to other property, the Trustee's objection to the exemption claimed in the Honda is SUSTAINED. An order in conformity with this Memorandum shall issue forthwith."
"Are payments on a loan with varying, different amounts of interest from payment to payment considered an avoidable preferential transfer under the code?","Given the nature of the services provided by Defendant to Debtors, and the nature of the business relationship between Debtors and Defendant, this Court does not find the variation in the amount of invoices and thus variation in payment amounts to dispel the ordinary course of business defense. Greater emphasis on the dollar amount of the invoices than that which was afforded by this Court would be an erroneous application of the facts because that inquiry is particular to the business relationship between Debtors and Defendant in a particular week and does not speak to the course of Debtors' and Defendant's relationship generally. Defendant has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the transfers are properly unavoidable by Plaintiff pursuant to Section 547(c)(2)(A)."
"Should debtor's case be dismissed or converted for failure to make direct payments to a creditor under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1328(a)?","Under the Bankruptcy Code, there are three ways to conclude a Chapter 13 case: “discharge pursuant to § 1328, conversion to a Chapter 7 case pursuant to § 1307(c) or dismissal of a Chapter 13 case ‘for cause’ under § 1307(c).” Leavitt v. Soto (In re Leavitt ), 171 F.3d 1219, 1223 (9th Cir.1999).19 With the first path precluded by the Debtor's failure to complete a major component of her Plan—her failure to make her Direct Payments to the Lender in accordance with the requirements of her confirmed Plan—only two options remain. A review of the Bankruptcy Code strongly suggests that there is no sufficient statutory authorization to simply close the case as proposed by the Trustee, when, as here, a discharge has not been entered because the Debtor failed to comply with the provisions of and complete all of the payments required under the confirmed Plan. Because the Debtor has failed to successfully complete her Plan according to its terms, the remedies available to the Trustee under the Bankruptcy Code are either conversion or dismissal of the case pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1307. The Motion requests only conversion or closure without discharge, with the latter remedy unavailable under the Bankruptcy Code. Dismissal or conversion could have materially different ramifications for the Debtor, her estate, and her creditors. In order to provide due and proper notice to the Debtor and all creditors and parties in interest of the outcome sought by the Trustee, the Court finds that the Trustee should file an amended motion containing an appropriate prayer for conversion or dismissal of the Debtor's case pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1307 (“Amended Motion”) within fourteen (14) days of the date of the entry of the order that shall be entered simultaneously with this Memorandum Opinion. The Court further finds that the Debtor should thereafter have fourteen (14) days to file an answer to the Amended Motion. The Court will set the matter for hearing following the filing of the Amended Motion and the Debtor's response thereto."
"Are liquor taxes dischargeable in texas?","Because Hartford has met its burden of proving that it is entitled to be subrogated to the nondischargeability rights of the State of Texas, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED."
"Should reference of avoidance proceeding against a non-creditor be withdrawn pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stern?","Defendant argues that the reference should be withdrawn because (1) the Bankruptcy Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the non-bankruptcy related claims against a non-debtor defendant, and (2) the requirements for permissive withdrawal are satisfied. (Motion, at 2.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court disagrees and denies the motion to withdraw the reference. As a threshold matter, the Court notes that the Bankruptcy Code includes a broad grant of subject matter jurisdiction over a debtor's property: “The district court in which a case under title 11 is commenced or is pending shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all of the property, wherever located, of the debtor as of the commencement of such case, and of property of the estate.” 28 U.S.C. § 1334(e). Thus, a bankruptcy court may enter an order affecting a non-debtor's interest in certain property if the court has personal jurisdiction over the non-debtor or in rem jurisdiction over the property. In re Feldman, 309 B.R. 422, 428 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.2004) (citing In re Price, 304 B.R. 769 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2004)). Nevertheless, “[w]hile a debtor submits to the jurisdiction over the bankruptcy court by filing the petition, no such jurisdiction is invoked over a non-debtor spouse,” courts have “consistently found that in rem jurisdiction obtains where a debtor shares a common ownership interest with the nondebtor in real property, such that the property becomes ‘property of the estate’ under Section 541 of the Code.” Id. (internal citation omitted). Therefore, assuming arguendo that both Trombas have a valid property interest in the Premises at issue, it is clear that the Bankruptcy Court has in rem jurisdiction over and can affect Ms. Tromba's interest in the Premises. Turning specifically to Ms. Tromba's argument that the claims against her should not be litigated in the Bankruptcy Court, this Court concludes that withdrawal is not warranted, even though, pursuant to Stern, the Bankruptcy Court lacks authority to enter final judgment on the fraudulent conveyance and preference claims. A. Final Adjudicative Authority The Court briefly addresses the Bankruptcy Court's final adjudicative authority although Trustee and ESB concede that none of the exceptions in Stern apply to the Trustee's fraudulent conveyance and preferential transfer claims against defendant. (Trustee Opp. Mem. ¶ 25.)"
"Should a no asset case be reopened to include allegedly inadvertently omitted creditors?","At the end of the day, the only question the Motion requires the court to answer is whether there is cause to reopen the case under § 350(b). The complexities described above should not obscure the fact that the parties are embroiled in a controversy involving the scope of the Debtors' discharge, a matter within this court's concurrent jurisdiction. In order for the court to make that jurisdiction available in order to accord relief to the Debtors, the court must reopen the case. The court will reopen the case for sixty days for this purpose."
"Will a creditor's amended claim including postpetition attorneys' fees and costs not covered in its initial proof of claim be allowed?","Shallowford argues in this case that its amendment to add actual post-petition attorney's fees was preserved by virtue of its reservation in its original proof of claim, which reserved the right to file an unsecured deficiency claim and reserved its right to collect post-petition attorney's fees under Section 506(b). The Debtor responds that, because Shallowford is not oversecured, it has no claim for attorney's fees under Section 506(b) and it did not reserve the right to add attorney's fees under any other section of the Code. Moreover, the Debtor argues the reservation in the original proof of claim to file an unsecured claim was based solely on the valuation of the property, which at the time had not been ascertained. The Debtor contends this is a new claim, not reserved in the original proof of claim. The Court agrees this amendment is not covered by the reservation in the first claim. Moreover, since Shallowford is not oversecured, it has no claim for attorney's fees under Section 506(b). (Shallowford agrees.) It's only claim for attorney's fees would be based on the terms of the contract and state law. Under Georgia law, O.C.G.A. § 13–1–11 governs the collection of attorney's fees. It provides that attorney's fees may be collected only if notice is given to the obligor and an opportunity is provided to pay all amounts due other than attorney's fees within 10 days. Upon the giving of notice and the passage of 10 days, the right to statutory attorney's fees becomes fixed. O.C.G.A. § 13–1–11 provides further that, if the contract provides for “reasonable fees” (which is what Shallowford's contract provides), reasonable fees shall be 15% of the first $500 of principal and interest due and 10% of the balance. There is no provision under Georgia law for Shallowford to have collected actual attorney's fees, either pre- or postpetition. It was limited to statutory fees. Shallowford gave the appropriate notice in 2011, more than a year before the Debtor filed this bankruptcy case. Therefore, it could have included statutory attorney's fees in its original proof of claim as its right to those fees was fixed at the time the petition was filed."
"When will a transfer be avoided on the basis of the debtor not having received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for a transfer made for the benefit of the debtor's individual shareholder?","“A bankruptcy court's finding of reasonably equivalent value is a factual determination subject to a ‘clearly erroneous' standard of review.” In re TransTexas Gas Corp., 597 F.3d 298, 306 (5th Cir.2010). “The question of reasonable equivalence is ‘largely a question of fact, as to which considerable latitude must be allowed to the trier of the facts.’ ” Id. (quoting In re Dunham, 110 F.3d 286, 289 (5th Cir.1997)). The bankruptcy court found from the evidence that “[t]he Transfer was made for the benefit of ... Daryanani, who was individually purchasing Alcala's and Mokhabery's 20% jointly-held membership interest in Starman Six with funds from the Debtor's operating account.” Inspirations I, 2013 WL 4052869, at *1. This finding is not clearly erroneous. The parties stipulated that “[t]he document that was supposed to evidence the transfer of Alcala's and Mokhabery's Starman Six Membership Interest to Daryanani is a Mutual Release dated February 4, 2009 (the ‘Mutual Release’).” R. 104. The Mutual Release, however, which purports to release claims by and against both Daryanani and Inspirations, is not a conveyance document and states nothing about the person or entity to whom the membership interest was transferred."
"When will summary judgment in a fraudulent transfer proceeding be denied due to issues of fact concerning lender's good faith and due diligence?","In sum, the deposition testimony on record falls far short of establishing that Mercantile was on inquiry notice of Pearlman's fraud or poor financial condition, let alone that Mercantile had actual knowledge of such facts. Rather, the testimony raises significant factual issues about the trustee's allegations. Moreover, any issues concerning what Mercantile knew and how it processed that information are rife with questions of fact that preclude summary judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, the Court finds the trustee is not entitled to summary judgment on the issue of Mercantile's good faith defense. For the foregoing reasons the Court will deny the trustee's motion for partial summary judgment. An order consistent with this memorandum opinion will be entered simultaneously."
"Does a bankruptcy court have jurisdiction to issue final orders on trustee avoidance claims in light of Stern v. Marshall?","I agree with my colleagues that Stern's holding should be read narrowly and thus restricted to the case of a “state-law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor's proof of claim.” 131 S.Ct. at 2620. I note also that numerous other recent decisions have agreed with the narrow interpretation. See, e.g., Kirschner v. Agoglia (In re Refco, Inc.), 461 B.R. 181 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2011); Fox v. Picard (In re Madoff),–F.Supp.2d–, Nos. 10 Civ. 4652(JGK), 10 Civ. 7101(JGK), 10 Civ. 7219(JGK), 11 Civ. 1298(JGK), 11 Civ. 1328(JGK), 2012 WL 990829 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2012). Like this Court in Direct Response, both the Refco and Madoff courts concluded that a fraudulent transfer action can be adjudicated by the bankruptcy court. Direct Response, 2012 WL 112503, at *11 (“[P]reference and fraudulent transfer claims arise both under Title 11 and in a case under Title 11 and are by definition ‘core’ issues under § 157(b)(2)(F) & (H) for which a bankruptcy court has authority to enter final adjudications.”); Refco, 461 B.R. at 192 (“Given the repeated and emphatic limiting language in Stern, ... and the role of fraudulent transfer claims under the Bankruptcy Code, including their management and resolution ultimately by the bankruptcy courts in the context of Congress' bankruptcy scheme, Article III of the Constitution does not prohibit the bankruptcy courts' determination of fraudulent transfer claims under 11 U.S.C. §§ 544 and 548 by final judgment.”); Madoff, 2012 WL 990829, at *12 n. 5 (“[Appellant] points to no language in Stern that can reasonably be interpreted as holding that the power explicitly accorded by Congress to the bankruptcy courts to enter judgment in fraudulent transfer actions ... violates Article III of the United States Constitution. The specific issue in Stern was the constitutional authority for a bankruptcy court to enter judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor's proof of claim.... The adjudication of fraudulent transfer and avoidance actions is a basic feature of that division of labor.”) (citations omitted). Thus, I find that Stern is not applicable to this action, as it does not involve a state-law counterclaim by the estate. Consequently, I conclude that I can enter a final judgment on the core preference, post-petition transfer, fraudulent transfer,9 and unjust enrichment claims and issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on the non-core causes of action."
"Can a retailer retroactively reject unexpired nonresidential real estate leases?","The Court granted the rejection as of the petition date in this instance. When Amber's made its Motion to reject the Petula Lease retroactively to the petition date, the Court considered the motion and granted it based on the fact that Amber's had turned over the keys and vacated the premises pre-petition, and served a motion to reject the lease as soon as possible. The Court concludes, based on the equities of the facts in this case that retroactive rejection of the lease to the petition date was warranted."
"When will good cause exist to justify a permissive extension of time for the trustee to serve an avoidance proceeding on a transferee?","The adversary proceeding relates to a bankruptcy case filed by Red Eagle Oil, Inc. (“Red Eagle”) under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The adversary complaint seeks to avoid and recover a preferential transfer pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 547. Suncor moved for the dismissal of the complaint alleging that r 2 advisors: (1) did not timely serve Suncor within the 120 days from the date the adversary complaint was filed; (2) that good cause does not exist to allow r 2 advisors an after-the-fact extension to serve the summons and complaint; and, (3) a permissive extension is not warranted."
"When will a creditor be entitled to the postpetition recording exception provided by 11 U.S.C.S. § 362(b)(3)?","To be eligible for this exception, BPPR has to satisfy three requirements: “there must be (1) an ‘act to perfect’ (2) an ‘interest in property’ (3) under circumstances in which the perfection-authorizing statute fits within the contours of section 546(b)(1)(A).” 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship v. Massachusetts Dept. of Envtl. Protection (In re 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship), 262 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2001). Section 362(b)(3)does not create new rights or interests for the creditor. “Instead, it merely permits perfection, or maintenance or continuation of perfection, free of the automatic stay that would otherwise be applicable, under circumstances in which the creditor's action would be effective against a trustee.” 3 Collier ¶ 362.05[4]."
"When will appellants be entitled to reconsideration of a bankruptcy order for expungement of claims?","Bankruptcy Rule 9024 provides that reconsideration motions in the bankruptcy court are governed by Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9024. Rule 60 provided: On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken. In this case, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Appellant failed to satisfy Rule 60(b). As the bankruptcy court properly determined, Appellant made only unsubstantiated allegations that she did not receive Appellee's objections to her claims. Even if Appellant had alleged to the bankruptcy court, as she does to this Court, that on March 6, 2007, she moved from one address in Miami to another but subsequently was unable to receive forwarded mail at her new address because the owner of the property rejected her mail and directed that it be returned, and as a result she never received Appellee's omnibus motion to disallow certain claims, including Claim 12512, her allegations are unsupported by any affidavits or other evidence. Appellant therefore failed to meet her burden under Rule 60(b). We have considered all of Appellant's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED."
"When will professional fees of individual members of the official committee of unsecured creditors be allowed?","Section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code sets forth the requirements for payment of an administrative expense claim in a Chapter 11 case. Section 503(b)(3)(F) provides for payment of “actual, necessary expenses” for individual members of a committee appointed under Section 1102 of the Bankruptcy Code, which includes an official committee of unsecured creditors. Section 503(b)(4) permits reimbursement of “reasonable compensation for professional fees rendered by an attorney” for certain specified parties listed in Section 503(b). See11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(4) (allowable only for entities “whose expense is allowable under subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) of paragraph (3) of this subsection”). Section 503(b)(3)(F) is not one of the subsections listed in Section 503(b)(4). So while expenses incurred by a member of an official committee are eligible for reimbursement under Section 503(b)(3)(F), the professional fees of an attorney of such committee members are not covered by Section 503(b)(4). As the Trustee notes in her objection, prior to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (“BAPCPA”) amendments of 2005, individual members of a committee could seek payment for such professional fees under Section 503(b)(4). See Trustee Objection at 18–22; 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(4) (2000) (amended 2005); see In re Lehman Bros. Inc., 487 B.R. 181, 190 n.7 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2013), appeal docketed, 13–cv–02211–RJS (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 3, 2013). In 2005, Congress rewrote Section 503(b)(4) to omit committee members as a party permitted to seek fees for professional compensation as an administrative expense, despite retaining other parties as eligible for such a payment. Given this statutory backdrop, the Trustee contends that any professional fees not explicitly authorized as an administrative expense under Section 503(b) cannot be paid. More specifically, the Trustee argues that members of the Committee are prohibited from having their professional fees paid. The Debtors, on the other hand, rely on the language of Sections 1123(b)(6) and 1129(a)(4) to argue that the payments are permissible. These sections allow for payments to be made through a plan of reorganization if, respectively, the payment is not inconsistent with applicable provisions of Chapter 11 and is reasonable. The permissibility of fees of this kind has been thoughtfully addressed by two other judges of this Court in Lehman Brothers, 487 B.R. 181 and In re Adelphia Commc'ns Corp., 441 B.R. 6 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2010). Both opinions conclude that such fees are permissible under the Bankruptcy Code when proposed and approved through a consensual plan. This Court reaches the same conclusion."
"When will a Chapter 7 trustee's motion for turnover of a joint tax refund belonging to the debtor and his non-bankruptcy filing wife be granted?","There is a split of authority with respect to the appropriate method for allocating joint tax refunds between a debtor and a non-bankruptcy filing spouse for purposes of determining what funds may be included in the bankruptcy estate, and there are at least three different lines of cases regarding this issue. The split of authority exists not just between various circuits or districts, but even within this district. The “minority approach,” employed by the Bankruptcy Court below, is to apportion the right to the refund equally, regardless of which spouse earned the income, paid withholdings, or caused any exemptions or credits to apply (hereinafter, the “50/50 Approach”). See generally In re Page, No. 10–10728–JKC–7A, 2012 WL 174293 (Bankr.S.D.Ind. Jan. 10, 2012); In re Smith, No. 09–7276–BHL–7A, 2011 WL 345865 (Bankr.S.D.Ind. Feb. 2, 2011). The 50/50 Approach uses an allocation method based upon domestic dissolution law and presumes that spouses share equal ownership in a tax refund, which may be rebutted only by evidence of a domestic relations court order or an enforceable, written pre-petition contract between the spouses designating alternative ownership of the refund. Smith, 2011 WL 345865, at *2; see also Ind.Code § 31–15–7–5 (Rebuttable presumption that an equal division of marital property between the parties is just and reasonable). The rationale for the rule is that it provides a “bright-line rule which is easy to understand and apply,” and because a debtor spouse is jointly responsible and liable for a joint federal income tax deficiency, so should he or she “share in the good fortune of a tax refund.” Smith, 2011 WL 345865, at *2."
"Does the bankruptcy court have the authority to abstain from hearing Trustee's fraudulent conveyance action against debtor because a state court had already ruled on matter?","Here, the Court concludes that judicial economy favors denial of the request to abstain. Though the bankruptcy relief Debtors seek relies on state law and, in fact, state law issues might be viewed as predominating, there is a significant possibility that the parties would be required to return to this Court to deal with the consequences of any judgment rendered by the State Court. Trying all the issues before a single court in a single proceeding fosters judicial economy and is in the economic interests of the litigants as well. The Court appreciates that the State Court action is already somewhat advanced. Debtors' bankruptcy was filed the day before a summary judgment hearing was scheduled in State Court. However, the State Court case is not all that old, and the State Court's rulings to this point relate only to payments required to protect BARO while Debtors sought to advance their claims. Nothing submitted indicates that the State Court was particularly close to a resolution of the primary issues or, for that matter, that summary judgment would be any more likely in State Court than here."
"Does the court have the authority to authorize fees incurred by the Chapter 7 trustee and retained professionals out of an ERISA plan's assets in acting as an ERISA plan administrator?","In this case, the basis for “related to” jurisdiction over the payment provisions of the Proposed Order cannot be its mere relationship to the bankruptcy Trustee; rather, there must be a closer connection to the underlying bankruptcy case. The thrust of the order relates to the Trustee's decision to charge the Plan with the Bank's fee. In that regard, the activity covered by the Proposed Order relates to non-estate assets for which the Trustee has personal, fiduciary duties created by ERISA. The estate and its creditors are not affected by the outcome of the Trustee's decision to pay the administrative costs from the Plan. The court can find nothing in the Proposed Order that relates to the underlying bankruptcy case beyond the coincidental identities of the Plan's administrator and the bankruptcy estate's trustee, which the court finds is an insufficient nexus for asserting its authority over what fees and costs may be properly payable from the Plan. IV. CONCLUSION The relief sought in the Proposed Order does not depend upon a resolution of bankruptcy law, and concerns activity that frequently exists outside the context of bankruptcy cases. Therefore, the order does not “arise under” title 11 or “arise in” the bankruptcy case. Moreover, because the Proposed Order governs the Trustee's ERISA fiduciary obligations to a non-estate trust, and the order could not impact the administration of the bankruptcy estate, the order does not “relate to” the bankruptcy case. Therefore, the court has no jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1334 to grant entry of the Proposed Order. Given that the court has concluded that it lacks the jurisdiction to enter the Proposed Order, the Department's additional objections to the order will not be addressed."
"Does a presumption of abuse of the bankruptcy code apply in a case where debtor underreported his gross income and claimed excessive child care expenses?","As indicated above, it is necessary to determine initially whether a presumption of abuse arises based on the Debtors' income and allowable living expenses. The parties have stipulated that their aggregate income exceeds “the applicable stated median family income of $87,546 for the debtors' household of six.” (Stipulation ¶ 4.) By reason of such fact a statutory presumption of ability to pay their creditors arises pursuant to § 707(b)(2) when the Debtors' current monthly income, less the Debtors' monthly expenses under the National and Local Standards along with any additional reasonable necessary average monthly expenses (the “net disposable income”), multiplied by sixty, is at least a minimum amount calculated according to a formula set forth in the statute, which is quoted in the immediately preceding footnote. In this case, the Debtors' nonpriority unsecured claims, as listed in Schedule F to their petition, total $137,066. Twenty-five (25) percent of that amount is $34,266.50, which of course is more than $10,950. Accordingly, the issue presented under the facts of this case is whether the Debtors' net disposable monthly income, multiplied by sixty, is at least $10,950, which means that their net disposable income must be at least $182.50 per month. As previously noted, according to their Means Test the Debtors reported a negative monthly disposable income of $1,143.55, so in order for a presumption of abuse to arise under § 707(b)(2), the Court must determine that as a result of under reported income or excessive expenses, or a combination of both, the Debtors' monthly disposable income, properly determined, is at least $1,326.05 more than they scheduled."
"Can the Chapter 13 trustee modify debtor's unconfirmed plan to provide for increased payments to unsecured creditors on the basis that debtor's income increased under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1325(b)?","The Trustee maintains that Watters stands for the proposition that certain types of income, e.g., personal injury awards, social security benefits and worker's compensation, which are otherwise exempt under Chapter 7 but included in the definition of “disposable income,” should be paid solely to the debtor's unsecured creditors. This Court disagrees with such an interpretation of Watters. To be included in the definition of “disposable income” under 11 U.S.C. § 1325(b)(2) merely means that the income is available to fund a Chapter 13 plan. Neither the Code nor case law support the Trustee's argument that certain types of disposable income are intended to benefit any one class of creditors at the exclusion of any other. Rather, the income must be applied to plan payments, subject to the terms of the Chapter 13 plan. While the class action/worker's compensation proceeds at issue here constitute disposable income, as both Watters and the Debtors' plans indicate, no special distribution to the Debtors' unsecured creditors is warranted. Rather, the proceeds must be applied pursuant to the distribution scheme set forth in the Debtors' plans."
"Did the bankruptcy court commit reversible error where it voided an early termination provision of debtor's Chapter 13 plan and extended the term to 5 years under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1325(b)(4)?","Carrington Mortgage is misguided in its belief that the Debtor must stay in the plan for the entire sixty (60) months as proposed. Section 1325(b)(4)(B) provides that “[f]or purposes of this subsection, the ‘applicable commitment period’—(B) may be less than 3 or 5 years, ..., but only if the plan provides for payment in full of all allowed unsecured claims over a shorter period.”"
"Does the Chapter 12 bankruptcy court have the authority to dismiss debtor's postconfirmation avoidance proceeding under 28 U.S.C.S. §§ 1334(b) because it involves preconfirmation activities?","With this general framework in mind, we acknowledge that the post-confirmation posture of this case complicates our analysis somewhat. Section 1334 does not expressly limit bankruptcy jurisdiction upon plan confirmation. Consequently, several courts have adapted the broad “related to” test for application in post-confirmation disputes. Those courts find that a proceeding falls within the jurisdictional grant if it has “a conceivable effect on the debtor's ability to consummate the confirmed plan....” In the recent case of In re Craig's Stores of Texas, Inc., however, we rejected this expansive view in favor of a “more exacting theory”: “After a debtor's reorganization plan has been confirmed, the debtor's estate, and thus bankruptcy jurisdiction, ceases to exist, other than for matters pertaining to the implementation or execution of the plan.” Although we can imagine cases where the two approaches would produce different results, bankruptcy jurisdiction existed over the Appellants' motion in this case, even under the narrower test. The U.S. Brass reorganization plan has been substantially consummated, but it has not been fully consummated. The Appellants still have an obligation to resolve the Shell/CNA claims, and that obligation is at the heart of this dispute. Although section 8.20(b) of the plan provides that Shell and CNA are entitled to assert their claims “by institution of litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction,” they now intend to submit the claims to binding arbitration. Thus, in opposition to the motion, the Insurers rely on the Bankruptcy Code's prohibition on modification of a substantially consummated plan of reorganization. The Appellants contend, on the other hand, that their proposed agreement—including the arbitration provision—is fully consistent with the plan. Bankruptcy law will ultimately determine this dispute, and the outcome could affect the parties' post-confirmation rights and responsibilities. Furthermore, this proceeding will certainly impact compliance with or completion of the reorganization plan. Consequently, the Appellants' motion pertains to the plan's implementation or execution and therefore satisfies the Craig's Stores test for post-confirmation jurisdiction."
"Does the bankruptcy court have the authority to grant the trustee's motion to modify a stipulation and agreed order that provided for abandonment of real property where the abandonment was proper and effective?","Lastly, the Court finds that the Hotel's abandonment did not result from a mistake or false or misleading information. The parties reached a settlement after they negotiated for many months with the assistance Mr. Skaggs and the parties discussed the proposed abandonment with Judge Myers when they announced the settlement in open court. The Stipulation and Agreed Order was not ambiguous with respect to the parties' intentions regarding the Hotel's potential abandonment. Thus, based on the record, the Court finds that the abandonment in this case was proper and effective. Therefore, the Court REVERSES the bankruptcy court's decision regarding abandonment."
"In the Second Circuit, what is the standard for establishing the reliance element of a section 10(b) securities fraud claim?","In other words, the premise of Rittenberry's testimony, and GAMCO's argument, assumes what it seeks to prove: that GAMCO would have known that the liquidity problems would manifest in the way that, in hindsight, they manifested, and would thus obviously have waited to buy if it purchased at all. But the district court's rejection of that conclusion was not clearly erroneous. Further, GAMCO exaggerates the probative value of Rittenberry's testimony in another way as well. Even on its own terms, Rittenberry's testimony does not clearly suggest that GAMCO would not have bought if it had known of the hidden liquidity risks. Asked whether knowledge of such a hidden crisis would ""not affect"" his buy or sell recommendation, Rittenberry, not unlike Gabelli, answered equivocally: ""no, not necessarily."" J.A. 401 (emphasis added). And, when describing what his recommendation would be, he did not say that he would recommend that GAMCO not buy; instead, he testified that ""if [he] thought [the market price] was going to go down, [he] would wait to buy it or buy more or recommend to buy more at that point."" Id. (emphasis added). In other words, the district court did not have to read this testimony as GAMCO reads it. Instead, it could reasonably have read Rittenberry's testimony as suggesting that GAMCO would buy and then wait and buy more if indeed the liquidity problems surfaced. Such an approach would potentially allow GAMCO to ensure it captured a good deal when it saw one while hedging against the possibility of an uncertain future.    It may seem unlikely, in the abstract, that an investor, aware of fraud, would opt to purchase a given security. Nevertheless, after a trial, we do not review a district court's factual findings for whether they seem, in the abstract, correct — we review the record for sufficient evidence in support of those judgments. And here, the record at the trial simply does not establish that it was clearly erroneous for the district court to find that GAMCO, had it known of the liquidity problems at Vivendi, would have made the choice to buy the same securities it purchased."
"Are claims under a consulting agreement entitled to priority under 507(a)(4)?","In this case, Claimant's claim is based on Debtor's obligations under the Agreement to pay for employment services provided by Advanced Alternative Employment Solutions, LLC. Initially, the court notes that the Agreement is between Debtor and Advanced Alternative Employment Solutions, LLC, not Debtor and Nietrzeba. Although the proof of claim designates Claimant as ""Chris Nietrzeba dba Advanced Alternative Employment Solutions, LLC,"" the ""dba"" or ""doing business as"" designation does not appear to be an accurate description of the relationship between Nietrzeba and the LLC. A ""doing business as"" designation is merely descriptive of the person who does business under some other name. [Citation Omitted]. It does not involve an entity separate from the person operating the business. [Citation Omitted]. Here, Advanced Alternative Employment Solutions, LLC, appears to be a separate entity and not merely descriptive of Nietrzeba. Nevertheless, because the Trustee has objected only to the priority status of the claim and not to the claim itself, the court will construe the proof of claim as being filed by Advanced Alternative Employment Solutions, LLC. Claimant first argues that the claim is, in part, for wages earned by individuals within the meaning of § 507(a)(4)(A). The purpose of the wage priority in § 507(a)(4)(A) is ""'to enable employees displaced by bankruptcy to secure, with some promptness, the money directly due to them in back wages, and thus to alleviate in some degree the hardship that unemployment usually brings to workers and their families.'""[Citation Omitted].  Courts applying that provision have held that it applies only to wages earned by an individual, and that corporations are not entitled to a wage priority. [Citation Omitted]. Courts have also held that to be entitled to the wage priority, there must be an employer-employee relationship between the claimant and the debtor. [Citation Omitted] (finding corporation that was obligated to pay employees under a contract between it and the debtor was not entitled to a wage priority for providing the contract services)."
"Are make-whole provisions enforceable in bankruptcy?","Prepayment amounts, although often computed as being interest that would have been received through the life of a loan, do not constitute unmatured interest because they fully mature pursuant to the provisions of the contract. [Citation omitted]. As a result of the parties' contractual agreements, reflected in the terms of the Note and mortgage, the SBA has a right to receive this payment if payment of the entire amount due pursuant to the Note is made prior to the full term of the contract. Therefore, the Prepayment Amount does not constitute unmatured interest and will not be disallowed pursuant to § 502(b)(2)."
"Does a make-whole provision in a credit agreement represent a claim for unenforceable unmatured interest under Section 502(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code?","(b)  To the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which, after any recovery under subsection (c) of this section, is greater than the amount of such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement or State statute under which such claim arose."
"Should an exemption objection be stayed as the result of a criminal prosecution of the debtor?","Despite these factors, such “[a] stay of [a] civil case” to permit conclusion of a related criminal prosecution has been characterized as “an extraordinary remedy.” [Citation omitted] A district court may stay civil proceedings when related criminal proceedings are imminent or pending, and it will sometimes be prudential to do so. [Citation omitted] (“Even if a court may constitutionally deny a request for a stay, ... a stay of a civil action may still be warranted in some instances.”). But the Constitution rarely, if ever, requires such a stay. [Citation omitted] (“ ‘[T]he Constitution does not ordinarily require a stay of civil proceedings pending the outcome of criminal proceedings.’ ” [Citation omitted]."
"What is the standard of proof the district court should apply in determining a creditor's allegation that it did not have sufficient notice it could raise an antitrust claim against a Chapter 11 debtor?","We are skeptical of DHL's contention that it was not aware of, or with reasonable diligence could not have become aware of, its antitrust claim in time to assert it in the bankruptcy proceeding. But whether that contention is supportable and the related issue of whether due process required United to give DHL explicit notice of an antitrust claim should not be decided at the appellate level before the District Court has considered these matters under proper standards. Because the District Court erred in accepting as true DHL's allegation of lack of sufficient knowledge to file an antitrust claim in bankruptcy, the matter must be remanded for reconsideration."
"Should the court apply §506(a)(2) to determine the replacement value of a vehicle the debtor intends to surrender under §1325(a)(5)(C)?","The United States Supreme Court in Associates Commercial Corp. v. Rash, 520 U.S. 953, 117 S.Ct. 1879, 138 L.Ed.2d 148 (1997), explicitly recognized the obvious applicability of § 506(a) to surrender under § 1325(a)(5)(C). Specifically, Justice Ginsburg, analyzing the language in section 506(a) that specifies valuation of collateral should be based upon its “disposition or use,” wrote: As we comprehend § 506(a), the “proposed disposition or use” of the collateral is of paramount importance to the valuation question.... [T]he debtor has two options for handling allowed secured claims: surrender the collateral to the creditor ... or, under the cram down option, keep the collateral over the creditor's objection and provide the creditor ... with the equivalent of the present value of the collateral.... The “disposition or use” of the collateral thus turns on the alternative the debtor chooses-in one case the collateral will be surrendered to the creditor, and in the other, the collateral will be retained and used by the debtor. 520 U.S. at 962, 117 S.Ct. 1879. Because section 506 was applicable to the surrender of collateral before the 2005 amendments, and makes the situation incoherent if no longer applicable, we believe the best solution is to regard section 506 as continuing to apply to surrender cases."
"Can the court order debtor's counsel to refund attorney fees to debtor where counsel failed to recover debtor's repossessed truck, which caused debtor to file for bankruptcy relief in the first place?","In this case, the Court is faced with the task of reviewing a debtor's attorney fee under § 329 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under that section, if a fee charged by a debtor's attorney is excessive, the Court can order the attorney to return the excess. On December 5, 2013, Austin Ingram (the “Debtor”) hired Attorney Kayla Laswell (“Attorney Laswell”) to file a bankruptcy petition in an effort to recover possession of his 2008 Ford truck. Attorney Laswell filed the Debtor's Chapter 7 petition on December 9, 2013."
"Is a towing company in violation of the automatic stay for failure to release debtor's vehicle in order to protect a valid possessory lien?","Jensen Towing held the Debtor's Vehicle as the agent for the Sheriff who seized the Vehicle pursuant to Wilson's execution. Wilson, not the Sheriff or Jensen Towing, was the Debtor's creditor who exercised control over property of the estate by failing to take affirmative steps to cause the release of the Vehicle. Jensen Towing may have been a custodian in possession of bankruptcy estate property, and could have been compelled to release the Vehicle in a turnover action. No such action was filed. Instead, the Bank accused Jensen Towing of violating the automatic stay. Jensen Towing had a valid possessory lien under Wis. Stat. § 779.415(1g)(a), and did not violate the stay by refusing to release the Vehicle which would have caused Jensen Towing to lose its lien. Jensen Towing's threat to sell or junk the Vehicle if the Debtor or his grandmother did not respond within 20 days probably constituted a stay violation. Had Jensen Towing carried out this threat, the case would be different. But in the end, Jensen Towing released the Vehicle to the Debtor without requiring the payment of storage or towing charges. Under these circumstances, Jensen Towing is not liable for the Bank's attorneys' fees or for punitive damages under Bankruptcy Code § 362(k)."
"Does the court have discretionary authority to allow creditor to file a late proof of claim on the basis that creditor did not receive notice and lack of prejudice to the debtor?","Also relevant here are Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases. Although the rules in each case are not necessarily identical,3 the cases indicate that the bankruptcy court has no discretion but must allow late claims where a creditor has not received notice of the bar date—regardless of his actual knowledge of the bankruptcy proceedings. As to Chapter 11 cases, see Broomall Indus. v. Data Design Logic Sys., 786 F.2d 401, 405 (Fed.Cir.1986); In re Yoder Co., 758 F.2d 1114 (6th Cir.1985); Reliable Elec. Co., Inc. v. Olson Constr. Co., 726 F.2d 620, 623 (10th Cir.1984); In re Nutri*Bevco, Inc., 117 B.R. 771 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1990); In re Uiterwyk Corp., 105 B.R. 103, 105 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1989). As to Chapter 13 cases, see In re Zwerling, supra."
"Can debtor strip a junior mortgage from real property via a Motion to Avoid Lien and modifying the plan post-confirmation by retroactively reclassifying status under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1329?","A construction of § 1329(a) that allows reclassification of secured claims to unsecured claims reads the requirements of § 1325(a)(B)(5) out of the Code. In re Dunlap, 215 B.R. 867, 870 (Bankr.E.D.Ark.1997). Once allowed, a secured claim is fixed in amount and status and must be paid in full. 11 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii). Therefore, § 1329(a)(1) can only be read to allow a modification in the amount of payment on a secured claim to accelerate or slow the rate at which the claim is paid, not to alter the amount of the claim. In re Coleman, 231 B.R. 397, 399 (Bankr.S.D.Ga.1999). “In other words, altering the amount or timing of payments on a secured claim cannot change the fact that, in the end, the full amount of the secured claim established, as of the effective date of the plan, must be paid.” Id. at 399–400. Otherwise, modification in order to reclassify claims subjects the secured creditor to the unilateral whims of a debtor throughout the life of the plan. Id. at 400. Since the amount and status of a claim is fixed at confirmation and § 1329 does not permit revaluation of collateral or reclassification of claims post-confirmation, the parties are bound by the amount of a secured claim under § 1327 and the amount of the claim must be paid in full. In re Coleman, 231 B.R. at 401–02; In re Meeks, 237 B.R. at 861–62. This court holds that § 1329 does not permit a debtor to modify the classification of a creditor's allowed secured claim from secured to unsecured. Confirmation of the debtor's plan is res judicata as to the amount and classification of a secured creditor's claim."
"Can a bankruptcy court properly sanction creditors for joining debtors as parties to a personal injury action despite debtors' discharge injunction under 11 U.S.C.S. § 524(a)?","The Bankruptcy Court did not err in finding that Creditors willfully violated the Debtors' discharge injunction—a matter that falls within the Bankruptcy Court's contempt powers. See e.g., In re Canning, 706 F.3d 64, 69 (1st Cir.2013). The lift stay order no longer applied and Creditors willfully proceeded to obtain a judgment against Debtors individually. The Bankruptcy Court's fact findings were not clearly erroneous, the determinations of law were correct under a de novo review, and there was no abuse of discretion in holding Creditors responsible for their conduct. Creditors' Cross–Appeal Issue 1 is OVERRULED."
"Can plaintiffs' claims in a qui tam action against debtor under the False Claims Act be excepted from discharge pursuant to the BAPCPA?","For the foregoing reasons, the July 24, 2013 order of the bankruptcy court is REVERSED in part. The adversary proceeding is REMANDED to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. SO ORDERED."
"Does a bankruptcy court have authority to impose sanctions against creditor's counsel pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S. § 1927 for filing baseless counterclaims and causing trustee to incur additional attorney fees?","As both this Court and the Bankruptcy Court concluded, the Counterclaims were clearly without merit. The Bankruptcy Court acknowledged that Dahiya possesses strong personal convictions regarding “fairness and equity under the Bankruptcy Code,” but found that “where there is no colorable basis to bring [a claim], even the most laudable of motivations cannot provide a proper purpose for having done so, or infuse merit into a groundless claim.” In re Khan, 488 B.R. at 535. Based on the record as a whole, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that, by bringing the Counterclaims, Dahiya had let his “passion [and] policy concerns overwhelm [his] professional judgment ... at the expense of [his] client's interests.” Id. at 534. The Bankruptcy Court also noted that Dahiya had brought similar counterclaims against other trustees in various contexts. Id. (citing cases). Under the circumstances of this case, it was reasonable for the Bankruptcy Court to infer that Appellant had brought the Counterclaims for an improper purpose—namely, to pursue his own policy concerns regarding the fairness of trustees' administration of bankruptcy estates. Moreover, although Appellant claims that his actions did not “multiply the proceedings” (App.'s Mem. at 24), the record clearly supports the Bankruptcy Court's finding that “Dahiya's assertion of the Counterclaims [ ] caused significant and unnecessary delay in [the] adversary proceeding and in the administration of the Debtor's bankruptcy case, and [ ] increased the costs of these proceedings.” In re Khan, 488 B.R. at 535. Under the circumstances of this case, the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bad faith on the part of the Appellant and in finding that his actions needlessly multiplied the proceedings."
"Does debtor's unilateral sale of secured chattel without paying secured lender constitute a conversion of property, leading to nondischargeable debt?","We next turn to Davis v. Aetna Acceptance Co., supra. Davis involved what is essentially now known as a “floor financing” arrangement between a lender and a retail automobile dealer. It must be borne in mind that at the time that both McIntyre and Davis were decided, there was no 11 U.S.C. § 523(c): the discharge of an indebtedness by operation of the filing of bankruptcy was an affirmative defense to be asserted in response to an action on the indebtedness itself, and these two decisions arose from state court determinations on the affirmative defenses of “discharge in bankruptcy” asserted by the debtors against the respective creditors in each of those state court proceedings. Thus, in part, Davis reviewed the findings of fact and conclusions of law of a state court which specifically found that Davis “was not actuated by willful, malicious or criminal intent in disposing of the car in question” [55 S.Ct. at 153], despite finding that Davis had in fact committed conversion of the creditor's security interests in a motor vehicle which served as collateral for Davis' obligation to the creditor on essentially a “floor planning” arrangement. For the purposes of Geiger's reliance upon Davis, the most that can be said is that the tort of “conversion” may give rise to an exception to discharge under § 523(a)(6), but that the acts of the debtor with respect to the conversion must demonstrate “willfulness and malice”, i.e., the two concepts are separate, and “willful” means that the debtor actually intends, at the time of the conversion, to injure the creditor by depriving it of property rights which it has in its collateral. As stated in Justice Cardozo's decision for a unanimous Court: The respondent contends that the petitioner was liable for a willful and malicious injury to the property of another as the result of the sale and conversion of the car in his possession. There is no doubt that an act of conversion, if willful and malicious, is an injury to property within the scope of this exception. Such a case was McIntyre v. Kavanaugh, 242 U.S. 138, 37 S.Ct. 38, 61 L.Ed. 205, where the wrong was unexcused and wanton. But a willful and malicious injury does not follow as of course from every act of conversion, without reference to the circumstances. There may be a conversion which is innocent or technical, an unauthorized assumption of dominion without willfulness or malice. Boyce v. Brockway, 31 N.Y. 490, 493; Laverty v. Snethen, 68 N.Y. 522, 527, 23 Am.Rep. 184; Wood v. Fisk, 215 N.Y. 233, 239, 109 N.E. 177; Stanley v. Gaylord, 55 Mass. 536, 1 Cush.(Mass.) 536, 550, 48 Am.Dec. 643; Campau v. Bemis, 35 Ill.App. 37; In re De Lauro (D.C.), 1 F.Supp. 678, 679. There may be an honest but mistaken belief, engendered by a course of dealing, that powers have been enlarged or incapacities removed. In these and like cases, what is done is a tort, but not a willful and malicious one."
"Does debtor have standing to bring an action based on a prepetition cause of action where debtor filed for bankruptcy after his claim accrued and the trustee was the real party in interest under Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a)(1)?","Willess's personal injury claim accrued before he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and is the property of the bankruptcy estate. Because Willess does not have standing to prosecute this claim, the appeal is therefore DISMISSED for lack of standing."
"Is a transfer at the direction of debtor's parent corporation in order to satisfy the debt of the parent avoidable by the court as a preferential prepetition transfer?","For the foregoing reasons, the pending motions are decided as follows. Applying Bankruptcy Rule 9006 as written, the preference claim is timely, and the motion to dismiss Count V is denied. The Trustee has established all of the elements of a preferential transfer under § 547, and the Defendants have failed to establish any of the statutory defenses. The Trustee's motion for summary judgment in his favor on Count V is, therefore, granted. There are questions of fact regarding the elements of the fraudulent conveyance claims under § 548 and State law, and the Trustee's motion for summary judgment on Counts III and IV is denied at this time. On the record of this case, it is not possible to determine which State's law would apply to the claim for aiding and abetting a fraudulent conveyance, therefore, the motion to dismiss Count II is denied, without prejudice."
"Can a trustee avoid an allegedly fraudulent transfer made by debtor to the IRS towards the tax liability of its principal that was subsequently refunded?","Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code allows a trustee to “avoid any transfer ... of an interest of the debtor” made within the two years before the filing of a bankruptcy petition when “the debtor voluntarily or involuntarily ... received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation; and ... was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made.” 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(1)(B). A trustee may recover the value of a transfer avoidable under § 548 from “the initial transferee of such transfer.” 11 U.S.C. § 550(a)(1). The bankruptcy court found, and the parties do not disagree, that the eighth payment made by the Debtor to the IRS was avoidable under § 548 because the Debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer and did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange. The parties only dispute whether the IRS qualifies as an initial transferee from whom Menotte can recover under § 550(a)(1)."
"When will the division of property in a debtor's consent divorce decree be voided for being in violation of the automatic stay?","The filing of a petition operates as a stay of most proceedings and actions against the debtor, his property, and property of the bankruptcy estate. 11 U.S.C. § 362(a). However, exceptions to the automatic stay are set out in 11 U.S.C. § 362(b). In pertinent part, § 362(b)(2)(A)(iv) provides that the automatic stay does not apply to a proceeding “for the dissolution of a marriage, except to the extent that such proceeding seeks to determine the division of property that is property of the estate.” § 362(b)(2)(A)(iv)."
"Is a state court judgment against a debtor contractor based on defects in a garage constructed for a creditor nondischargeable on grounds of fraudulent misrepresentation ?","Plaintiff has failed to establish the first and essential element of a non-dischargeability action based on false representation—i.e., that Debtor made an actual misrepresentation or a false representation to her. As a consequence, it is not necessary—or even possible—for the Court to analyze the other elements of this cause of action. Without an actual misrepresentation, there can be no intent to deceive, no justifiable reliance and no proximate loss."
"When will equitable tolling be applied to allow a trustee to file an untimely complaint in a fraudulent conveyance proceeding?","In the case of fraud, or in this case a fraudulent transfer, application of the principle of equitable tolling requires the trustee to prove that: (1) the alleged fraud was concealed by affirmative acts or misrepresentations by any of the parties involved; or (2) if the fraud was not affirmatively concealed, it went undiscovered in spite of the trustee's due diligence to discover the fraud. Id. at 701. The equitable tolling doctrine is based on the principle that equity does not lend itself to fraud of any kind. Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 396, 66 S.Ct. 582, 584, 90 L.Ed. 743 (1946)."
"Should a debtor's discharge be denied due to transfer of cash to daughter 23 days prior to the petition date?","Based upon the foregoing, the Court finds that the Bankruptcy Administrator and Trustee have met their burden under both § 727(a)(2)(A) and § 727(a)(4)(A). The Court shall enter a separate judgment consistent with this memorandum opinion denying the Debtor's discharge."
"Is debtor's discharge subject to revocation under 11 U.S.C.S. § 727(d)(1) and (2) for failure to disclose a judgment award in the schedules upon advice of counsel?","The Trustee contends that the Debtor failed to disclose the $2,500 overpayment he was to recover from Linda Feeney–Sparrow, and that the $2,500 is property of the bankruptcy estate. The Trustee claims that the Debtor's failure to inform the Trustee of this asset constitutes the fraud required under 11 U.S.C. § 727(d)(1). To the contrary, the Debtor contends that this action was not fraud, as he relied upon the advice of his bankruptcy attorney who had informed him that he was free to proceed with the State Court Action, without notifying Trustee. At trial on the Trustee's Complaint, the Debtor testified that he had relied on advice given to him by his counsel, William A. Ward, Esq., in pursuing the State Court Action. The Debtor vehemently declared that he had believed he possessed the authority to bring the suit, and had no intention to conceal assets. Rather, the Debtor filed the State Court Action only to ensure that Linda Feeney–Sparrow would not “get away with it”. In this Court's view, reliance upon advice of counsel is a valid defense to fraud claims alleged against a debtor under 11 U.S.C. § 727(d)(1). In In re Georges, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that “the advice of counsel may provide an excuse for an inaccurate or false oath.” 138 Fed. Appx. 471, 472 (3d Cir.2005) (citing In re Topper, 229 F.2d 691, 693 (3d Cir.1956)). Although Georges was a case decided under 11 U.S.C. § 727(a), this Court finds it to be persuasive authority in light of the facts in the case at bar. In this matter, the Debtor had informed his counsel of his intent to pursue the judgment against Linda Feeney–Sparrow to recover the refund owed to him. His attorney in that matter had advised him that he did not need to inform the Trustee about the money to be recovered. Additionally, when the Debtor realized that the money to be collected from Linda Feeney–Sparrow was part of the bankruptcy estate, he had his attorney inform the Trustee that he would step aside in the Trustee's favor to allow the Trustee to pursue the State Court Action. Alternatively, the Trustee seeks to revoke the Debtor's discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 727(d)(2). Section 727(d)(2) provides that the court shall revoke a discharge if “the debtor acquired property that is property of the estate, or became entitled to acquire property that would be property of the estate, and knowingly and fraudulently failed to report the acquisition of or entitlement to such property, or to deliver or surrender such property to the trustee....” Thus, the elements of the Trustee's claim may be divided into four parts: (1) that the debtor acquired or became entitled to acquire certain property; (2) the property in question was property of the bankruptcy estate (or would be upon its acquisition); (3) the debtor failed to report the acquisition of or entitlement to such property or to deliver or surrender such property to the Trustee; and (4) in so failing to report or deliver or surrender the property, the debtor acted knowingly and fraudulently. Grossman v. Foster (In re Foster), 343 B.R. 385, 393 (Bankr.D.Mass.2006)."
"Can debtor modify the Chapter 13 plan under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1329 despite failure to provide for a cure of their payment default in order to avoid conversion or dismissal of the case?","The debtors' motion to modify is DENIED. The Trustee's motion to dismiss under § 1307(c)(6) is GRANTED, but the order of dismissal shall be stayed for 14 days to give the debtors an opportunity to convert their case to one under chapter 7."
"Did the bankruptcy court commit reversible error by finding that debtor retained an interest in property that had been sold at a foreclosure sale but before a deed was recorded by the purchaser?","As an initial matter, the Court observes that the parties wish to present, and argue, certain issues that were not noted in the notice of appeal nor decided by the Bankruptcy Court in its August 2013 order. The Court declines the opportunity to entertain any arguments not squarely on point to the ultimate issue. The lone issue before the Court is whether the Bankruptcy Court erred by finding that the Debtors retained an interest in the Property after it had been “hammered down” and sold at a foreclosure sale, but before a deed could be recorded by RBS. Resolution of this question necessarily decides the ultimate query of whether the Bankruptcy Court erred when it denied the Appellee's motion to lift the automatic stay, relative to the Bankruptcy Petition filed after the foreclosure sale but before the recording of the deed."
"Is debtor entitled to claim as an exemption his alleged interest in the proceeds of his mother's pension plan under 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(3)(C)?","Debtors argue that Mr. Jones's interest in his mother's Pension Plan is exempt under 11 U.S.C. § 522(b)(3)(C). The bankruptcy code permits debtors to exempt certain funds from the bankruptcy estate including “retirement funds to the extent that those funds are in a fund or account that is exempt from taxation under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.” Id. For funds to be exempt under § 522(b)(3)(C), the statute requires that “(1) the amount the debtor seeks to exempt must be retirement funds; and (2) the retirement funds must be in an account that is exempt from taxation under one of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code set forth therein.” In re Nessa, 426 B.R. 312, 314 (B.A.P. 8th Cir.2010). Inherited retirement accounts may also be exempted if they meet the two-prong exemption test set forth in Nessa. See id. This Court concludes that Mr. Jones's interest in the proceeds of his mother's Pension Plan is not exempt under § 522(b)(3)(C) because he does not have any interest in retirement funds and, even if he did, he has no interest in an account that is exempt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code. To determine whether an exemption is proper, the Court must look to the debtor's interest in property at the time of filing bankruptcy. United States v. Mitchell, 476 F.3d 539, 543 (8th Cir.2007) (stating “the bankruptcy estate includes property interests of the debtor at the commencement of the case, as well as proceeds of the estate.”); In re Schmitt, 215 B.R. 417 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.1997). At the time Debtors filed bankruptcy, Mr. Jones had no interest in the Pension Plan; he had only an interest in his mother's probate estate. He can exempt that interest from the bankruptcy estate only if the Pension Plan proceeds, after being disbursed to his mother's probate estate, are considered retirement funds in a tax-exempt account."
"Is it proper for a bankruptcy court in an adversary proceeding for fraud under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a) 2(A) to apply collateral estoppel to a state court judgment and hold that debt nondischargeable?","Collateral estoppel is applicable in bankruptcy dischargeability proceedings. Grogan v. Garner, 498 U.S. 279, 284, 111 S.Ct. 654, 112 L.Ed.2d 755 (1991). When the bankruptcy court is dealing with the effect of a state court judgment, the applicable rules of preclusion are those from the state in which the judgment was rendered. Plunk v. Yaquinto (In re Plunk), 481 F.3d 302, 307 (5th Cir.2007). Here, a Texas court found Sims liable for fraud, so the collateral estoppel law of Texas applies. Texas has defined collateral estoppel as: [More] narrow than res judicata in that it only precludes the re-litigation of identical issues of facts or law that were actually litigated and essential to the judgment in a prior suit. Once an actually litigated and essential issue is determined, that issue is conclusive in a subsequent action between the same parties. Van Dyke v. Boswell, O'Toole, Davis & Pickering, 697 S.W.2d 381, 384 (Tex.1985)."
"Does debtor employer's discharge injunction under 11 U.S.C.S. §§ 524(a), 1141(d)(1)(A) effectively bar an employee's wrongful termination case pursuant to 29 U.S.C.S. §§ 621, 623(a)(1)?","As a threshold matter, defendants argue that plaintiff's age discrimination claim pursuant to the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. §§ 621, was discharged by the issuance of a Chapter 11 Reorganization Plan in Bankruptcy Court.6 (Defs.' Mem. at 2.) In response, plaintiff argues that due to the defendants' failure to properly notify the plaintiff of their action in Bankruptcy Court and subsequent Reorganization Plan, his instant action should not be deemed discharged and barred. (Pl.'s Opp. at 12.)"
"Can the bankruptcy court assert jurisdiction over debtor's unjust enrichment counterclaim to creditor's breach of contract claim pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Stern v. Marshall?","Based upon a de novo review of the legal issue presented, the Court finds that under the unique facts of this case the Bankruptcy Court did have authority to issue a final judgment under the new standard set forth in Stern. The Court finds that Gorilla's unjust enrichment counterclaim was necessarily resolved by the Bankruptcy Court's resolution of 13 Holdings' breach of contract proof of claim. Although 13 Holdings is certainly correct that Judge Campbell, on rehearing, instructed that the Bankruptcy Court have the first opportunity to address Stern (Doc. 10–2 at 75), the Court also provided its initial comments regarding Stern in the context of this case. The Court first stated that: “Stern framed its holding with regard to the unconstitutionality of [28 U.S.C.] § 157(b)(2)(C) as applying in ‘one isolated respect’—where a Bankruptcy Court ‘enter[s] a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor's proof of claim.’ 131 S.Ct. at 2620.” (Id. at 74.) Under the facts of this case, the Court also made its initial finding that the jurisdictional anchor under Stern was 13 Holdings' proof of claim, and reiterated its earlier ruling that “Gorilla's counterclaims were core after finding that the counterclaims were necessary to resolve 13 Holdings' claim.” (Id.) On remand, the Bankruptcy Court's alternative ruling also concluded that Gorilla's counterclaim is exactly the kind of counterclaim that Stern held to be within the power of the bankruptcy courts to resolve. (Doc. 10–2 at 116–17.) The Bankruptcy Court found that Gorilla's counterclaim was necessarily resolved as part and parcel of the same determination undertaken to resolve 13 Holdings' proof of claim because it arose out of the same transaction. (Id. at 117.) The Bankruptcy Court found that the necessary resolution of Gorilla's counterclaim was much simpler than handling a trustee preference claim under Katchen, which is also under the core power of the bankruptcy courts. (Id. at 117–19.) In finding that resolution of the counterclaim was part and parcel of the same determination, the court reasoned: “the same must be said for Gorilla's counterclaim here which arises from the very same APA contract on which the [p]roofs of claims rested.” (Id. at 120.)"
"Was summary judgment properly granted to debtors in creditor's action under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a) in a nondischargeability proceeding where creditor failed to estaplish piercing of the corporate veil?","Summary judgment for the Defendants is appropriate here because the Plaintiffs, who bear the burden of proof at trial, see Guzzi v. Morano, 2013 WL 4042511, at *7 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 8, 2013), have failed to offer sufficient evidence supporting their claim that the corporate veil should be pierced so that Ronald and John may be held liable for the debt of Gigliotti Avignon."
"What does received mean in section 503(b)(9)?","The term ""received"" is not defined in the Bankruptcy Code. Other courts interpreting § 503(b)(9) have examined its history and its relationship to § 546(c), which governs reclamation. Having done so, they conclude that the terms used in § 503(b)(9) - including ""received"" – should be given the same meaning they have in § 546(c), and, since § 546(c) is derived from the reclamation provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, the court may look to the UCC for guidance. [Citations omitted].         Although ""receive"" is not defined by the UCC, the term ""receipt"" is, and it has been used in interpreting ""received"" in § 546(c) and § 503(b)(9). Both the UCC and Ohio's version of it define ""receipt"" as ""taking physical possession"" of the goods.  [Citation omitted]. This possession may be actual or constructive, [Citation omitted], and occurs when the seller ""can no longer stop delivery and is left only with the remedy of reclamation."" [Citation omitted]. Thus, the key to determining when goods are received is possession- whether actual or constructive - not title.  ""A person who knowingly has direct physical control over a thing, at a given time, is . . . in actual possession of it."" [Citation omitted]. From the time the silage was delivered to and placed in the bunkers on its property the debtor had control over it. The silage was located on the debtor's property; the debtor was responsible for its care and protection; the debtor bore the risk of any loss; and the debtor determined when and how much silage would be removed from the bunkers to feed its dairy herd. It is extremely difficult to see how all of this does not constitute actual physical possession, notwithstanding the locus of title. This reality is not changed by the license debtor granted the movants or attempts to characterize the arrangement as a bailment, with debtor acting as a bailee. The court concludes that the debtor received the silage when it was delivered to and placed in the bunkers on its property and not when it was removed and fed to the debtor's livestock. [Citations omitted].         The debtor received the silage more than twenty days prior to the commencement of the case. The motions for allowance of administrative expense claims filed by Louis Niese; John and Matt Niese; and Dennis and Roger Niese should be DENIED and an order doing so will be entered."
"Do goods have to be actually received in order to trigger a 503(b)(9) claim?","The phrase ""received by the debtor"" as used in Section 503(b)(9) means: possessed by the debtor, either actually or constructively. The bankruptcy court also correctly held that, under Section 503(b)(9), delivery to, or possession by, a debtor's customer under a drop-shipment arrangement does not constitute constructive possession by the debtor for Section 503(b)(9) purposes.         Because, in this case, Momenta never had actual or constructive possession of the drop-shipped goods, those goods were not ""received by the debtor"" for purposes of Ningbo's administrative expense claim under Section 503(b)(9), and that claim fails. Conclusion         The bankruptcy court's decision denying Ningbo's several administrative expense claims is AFFIRMED in all respects."
"Are Chapter 7 debtors with rental property required under 11 U.S.C.S. § 521(a)(2) to deliver title to the mortgage-holding creditor where creditor violated the discharge injunction?","Black's Law Dictionary 1484 (8th ed. 2004). As a matter of law, given the undisputed facts of this case the act of “surrender” does not obligate Chase to transfer title out of Debtors' names. “Consistently with the general principle that surrender of encumbered property leaves the secured creditor in control of the exercise of its remedies, a plan cannot require a secured creditor to accept a surrender of property or take possession of or title to it through repossession or foreclosure.” Hon. W. Homer Drake, Jr., Hon. Paul W. Bonapfel& Adam M. Goodman, Chapter 13 Practice and Procedure § 9C:9 at 682 (2010–11 ed.); In re Service, 155 B.R. 512, 515 (Bankr.E.D.Mo.1993) (“the Court cannot compel acceptance of the surrendered property”); In re White, 282 B.R. 418, 423 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2002) (“[T]he Code does not provide for the court or the debtor to direct the means by which the secured creditor deals with the surrendered property.”); Pratt v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp. (In re Pratt), 462 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir.2006) (in the context of 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(2)(a) in a chapter 7 “nothing in subsection 521(a)(2) remotely suggests that the secured creditor is required to accept possession of the [collateral] ... as such a reading would be at odds with well-established law that a creditor's decision whether to foreclose on and/or repossess collateral is purely voluntary and discretionary. Thus, we agree with the [creditor's] contention that the [debtors'] surrender did not require that it repossess the collateral if [the creditor] deemed such repossession cost ineffective.”) (emphasis in original); Canning v. Beneficial Maine, Inc. et al. (In re Canning), 442 B.R. 165, 172 (Bankr.D.Me.2011) (in a chapter 7 “[t]hough the Code provides debtors with a surrender option, it does not force creditor to assume ownership or take possession of collateral.”); but see Pigg v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (In re Pigg), 453 B.R. 728 (Bankr.M.D.Tenn.2011)(equitable remedy fashioned to address the attempted surrender of a condominium made uninhabitable by a flood, where bank had actively taken possession of the property)."
"Does the bankruptcy court have the authority to grant debtor's motion to reopen a bankruptcy case to file an agreement under 11 U.S.C.S. § 524 in order to reaffirm a debt?","Reaffirmation agreements cannot be signed after the discharge is granted, nor can the Court hold the required § 524(m) “undue hardship” hearing. Thus, to afford Debtor relief she seeks, the Discharge Order would have to be set aside ab initio. Under Midkiff, the Court may, in appropriate circumstances vacate the Discharge Order for limited purposes. It has no ability to do so retroactively, however, unless (unlike here) serious due process rights are involved. In cases such as this one, the hands of time cannot be turned back. The Motion therefore must be denied. The Court will enter an order consistent with this Opinion."
"Should debtor be denied discharge injunction where debtor owed a fiduciary duty to creditor under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(4) and participated in reckless conduct resulting in liquidation of creditor's assets?","The evidence is uncontroverted that Defendant liquidated Ms. Cheikers assets, and then transferred the money to Stevens, who purchased the six Maine properties and transferred them to the Robichaud's within one year of his petition date. Defendant admitted having beneficial interest, even though the properties were not in his name. He then failed to disclose the Maine properties and the criminal action against him in his bankruptcy petition. The Defendant proffered no explanation or accounting as to the value of the Maine Properties he transferred, stating only that they were facing foreclosure. He has been silent concerning any property in New York, or California that he admitted in earlier statements. The only reasonable inference to be made from such non-disclosure is an intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. Thus, given the nature of the nondisclosures, Defendant permitted the transfer of the Maine properties with such intent."
"Should the court deny confirmation to a chapter 13 plan that fails to provide for treatment of a creditor's note on debtor's residence that was due and payable on the petition date?","The Debtor's Plan can be confirmed under § 1322(c)(2) because BSV's Note became due prior to the Petition Date, and its claim is being paid in full prior to the Debtor's final Chapter 13 Plan payment. BSV's Note matured on February 25, 2015, which was more than five months prior to the Petition Date. The Debtor's Chapter 13 Plan provides for the claim held by BSV to be paid in full in the twelfth month of the Plan. The total payoff on the BSV Note is $427,397.98. The Debtor is proposing to pay, a full forty-eight months before the final Chapter 13 Plan payment is due, the sum of $457,000 to BSV. The proposed payoff includes interest at the contractual interest rate set forth in the Note. The loan officer who testified on behalf of BSV at the Hearing confirmed that the $457,000 payment in month twelve would be sufficient to satisfy BSV's claim in full. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Debtor's Chapter 13 Plan complies with § 1322(c)(2) and § 1322(b)(5) as it cures the pre-petition default by paying BSV the full amount of its claim in month twelve of the Debtor's proposed Plan. The Court finds that the Plan is proposed in good faith as it will provide funding sufficient to pay all creditors of the bankruptcy estate 100% of their allowed claims. Therefore, BSV's Objection to Confirmation is overruled and the Debtor's Plan can be confirmed."
"Does the bankruptcy court retain jurisdiction over debtor's claims under the Truth in Lending Act where the trustee abandoned the claim?","This Court ceased to have jurisdiction over the Plaintiff's claims upon the Chapter 7 Trustee's abandonment of those claims and the closing of the underlying bankruptcy case, after which there no longer was a bankruptcy estate. Retention of jurisdiction would be inappropriate based on the procedural history and particular facts of this proceeding. The Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED."
"Should the court deny confirmation of debtor's Chapter 13 plan for failure to properly provide for debtor's former spouse's claim for maintenance arrears by offering to pay a joint tax debt as an alternative?","In Chapter 13 cases, in order to obtain confirmation, plans must provide for payment in full of claims entitled to priority under § 507. 11 U.S.C. § 1322(a)(2). “Domestic support obligations” are entitled to such priority. 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(1)(A). Further, “domestic support obligations” are excepted from the general discharge granted to debtors upon completion of Chapter 13 plan payments. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5); 11 U.S.C. § 1328(a)(2). In contrast, property settlement obligations are not priority claims which must be paid in full under a Chapter 13 plan and are subject to being discharged upon completion of plan payments. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15); 11 U.S.C. § 1328(a)(2). Thus, the importance of the distinction between support and property settlement obligations is clear here. If the Debtor's obligations to Mr. Smith are “domestic support obligations,” the Debtor must propose to pay them in full through the Amended Plan, and the obligations will not be discharged unless they are paid in full. On the other hand, if the obligations are property settlement debts, Mr. Smith is entitled to receive only his pro rata share of the funds available in the Amended Plan to pay general unsecured creditors and, upon successful completion of plan payments by the Debtor, any remaining balance due to Mr. Smith will be discharged."
"Is debtor precluded from modifying creditor's claim secured by debtor's real property that was for both residential and rental purposes pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 1322(b)(2)?","11 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(2) prohibits the modification in a Chapter 13 plan of a “claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence.” As one judge wrote, “courts have engaged in a vigorous debate over the correct interpretation of § 1322(b)(2).” In re Moore, 441 B.R. 732, 739 (Bankr.N.D.N.Y.2010). The legal question before the court today boils down to this: Does “real property that is the debtor's principal residence” include real property that has a rental component? The majority of courts to have considered this question determined that a debtor may modify a mortgage in a Chapter 13 plan—that is, the anti-modification provision of § 1322(b)(2) does not apply—if the property it secures is a multi-unit property and the debtor resides in only one unit."
"What is the moving party's burden of proof under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8005 for staying the bankruptcy court's order denying their motion for a protective order from trustee's discovery requests?","According to the Fundamental Entities, this district has never addressed whether a party may be excused from preparing a privilege log. One reason for that may be that it is highly unusual for a party to seek that relief. Nonetheless, it may promote the public interest, as the Fundamental Entities suggest, to have the district court consider that issue. But that is different than the issue this Court must consider: whether a stay will serve the public interest. The Fundamental Entities do not cite any public interest in staying a party's obligation to disclose the existence of privileged documents (and the basis for the claim of that privilege, on the one hand, and potentially denying a party discovery she is entitled to, on the other hand)."
"Does the debtor have standing to pursue a civil RICO action regarding a fraudulent real estate transaction taken in debtor's name without her knowledge and consent?","Under § 541 of the Bankruptcy Code, all of a debtor's property, including legal claims, become part of the bankruptcy estate at the time the petition is filed. 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1); Cannon-Stokes, 453 F.3d at 448. The trustee may abandon a legal claim, but until then only the trustee, as the real party in interest, has standing to sue. Cannon-Stokes, 453 F.3d at 448; Biesek, 440 F.3d at 413. Moreover, if a legal claim is not scheduled or otherwise administered by the time the bankruptcy is closed, it forever remains property of the estate, and the trustee remains the real party in interest. 11 U.S.C. § 554(d); Parker v. Wendy's Int'l, Inc., 365 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2004)."
"Is a Chapter 7 debtor permitted to exempt voluntary repayment of disability payments to an employer under 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(g)(1)?","The trustee in this case recovered funds using her avoidance powers. Under § 522(g)(1), “[t]he debtor's right to exempt property the trustee recovers is subject to two (2) conditions, that: (1) the transfer of property was involuntary; and (2) the debtor did not conceal the property involved.” Funches v. Household Fin. Consumer Disc. Co. (In re Funches), 381 B.R. 471, 491–92 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.2008) (emphasis deleted). The contested issue here is whether the recovered transfer was a voluntary transfer by the debtor. The term “voluntary” is not defined by the Bankruptcy Code. The governing principle, then, is that it must be read in a manner that is consistent with its plain meaning unless the literal application of the provision will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters. United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 242 (1989). As one court noted, “the purpose behind § 522(g) ... was to allow an exemption ‘where a property interest has been involuntarily taken from a debtor by means such as execution, repossession or certification of a judgment, [because] it would be inequitable not to permit a debtor to assert an otherwise allowable exemption....’ “ Glass v. Hitt (In re Glass), 60 F.3d 565, (9th Cir.1995) (quoting In re Savage, 92 B.R. 259, 261 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1988)). The legislative history does not shed much light on what the drafters intended when they used the term “voluntary,” stating merely that the fixing of a judicial lien is an example of an involuntary transfer. See H.R. Rep. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 362 (1977), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 6318."
"Does the bankruptcy court have the authority to dismiss debtor's adversary proceeding against his bankruptcy counsel for failure to prevent a foreclosure?","Under the relevant case law, I find Debtors' complaint states a claim for which relief could be granted sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. The complaint taken as true reflects that Debtors paid more than three thousand dollars to the Richards Firm and the Richards Firm failed to distribute any money to the lender in violation of O.C.G.A. § 18–5–2 and § 18–5–3.2. From the complaint, the Court may “draw the reasonable inference” that the Richards Firm may be liable for receiving a fee in excess of the amount allowed by Georgia law and for failing to disburse funds. The Richards Firm argues the contract clearly shows the three thousand dollar fee was for attorneys fees and not for distribution to creditors. However, the alleged violation of the statute is a cause of action allowed by the Georgia statute independent of the contract between the parties. See O.C.G.A. § 18–5–4(b)(2); Moon v. CSA–Credit Solutions of America, Inc., 696 S.E.2d 486, 490 (Ga.Ct.App.2010) (concurrence) (violation of the Georgia Debt Adjustment Act is independent of the contract between the parties). The language of O.C.G.A. § 18–5–4(b)(2), specifically provides Debtors with the right to bring a cause of action for violation of the Georgia Debt Adjustment Act. See O.C.G.A. § 18–5–4(b)(2). As pled, Debtors' complaint states a claim that the Richards Firm's action violated Georgia's debt adjustment statutes and specifically seek the damages that are allowed under O.C.G.A. § 18–5–4(b)(2). Therefore, I find Debtors' complaint states a claim sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949. It is therefore ORDERED that the Richards Firm's Motion to Dismiss is DENIED."
"Is the district court's order to vacate and remand the bankruptcy court's order regarding attorney's fees an issue that can be brought before the appellate court?","OAK has filed a notice of appeal on the district court's order that required the bankruptcy court to perform judicial functions upon remand. The district court's order was not final and this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal accordingly. Therefore, this appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction."
"Are Class 3 and Class 4 creditors improperly classified as secured and unimpaired where security was used by claim that was prior in right?","The classification of Classes 3 and 4 as secured takes liberties with § 506(a)(1) and AHFC's rights to vote its unsecured claims. The case law supports this conclusion. In Tucson Self–Storage, a 9th Circuit BAP case, the BAP said that the option of an undersecured creditor to be treated as fully secured under § 1111(b)(2) belongs to a creditor, not the debtor. Several creditors were listed as unsecured in Tucson Self–Storage, but in separate unsecured classes from the general unsecured creditors—as opposed to being arbitrarily called “secured” as in our case—but, the underlying principle still holds: the choice to be treated as fully secured is the creditor's, not the debtor's. More factually analogous to our case is Birdneck Apartment Associates, an Eastern District of Virginia bankruptcy court decision. The debtor proposed to treat an undersecured creditor as fully secured, over the creditor's objection. The undersecured creditor did not wish to make the § 1111(b)(2) election. The court concluded: The issue thus presented is whether the debtor can force an undersecured creditor who has not made a § 1111(b)(2) election to nevertheless be treated as fully secured and thereby defeat the creditor's ability to vote the undersecured portion of its claim with other unsecured and impaired creditors. [footnote omitted] ... In essence, the debtor is attempting to “force” Potomac's § 1111(b)(2) election. If the 1111(b)(2) election is to maintain its intended character as a creditor remedy, debtors cannot be permitted to “force” the election against a creditor's interest by artificially classifying their claim as fully secured. In my view such a tactic is not supported by the letter or spirit of section 1111(b)(2)."
"Did the bankruptcy court properly deny creditor's challenge to the debtor's discharge under 11 U.S.C.S. § 727(a)(2)(A) for concealing assets and income?","For a creditor to meet his burden in denying a debtor his discharge pursuant to § 727(a)(2)(A) the creditor's burden of proof requires that the creditor show: 1. That the act complained of was done at a time subsequent to one year before the date of the filing of the petition; 2. With actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor or an officer of the estate charged with custody of property under the Bankruptcy Code; 3. That the act was that of the debtor or his duly authorized agent; 4. That the act consisted of transferring, removing, destroying or concealing any of the debtor's property, or permitting any of these acts to be done. 4 Collier on Bankruptcy para. 727.02 at 727–11 (15th Edition 1990)."
"Are wrongful death claims arising out of debtor's negligent acts related to debtor's bankruptcy under  28 U.S.C.S. § 1334 and should therefore be tried in the same court of law?","The determination of relatedness is specific to the facts of the cases at issue. See In re Boston Reg'l, 410 F.3d at 107 (“what is ‘related to’ a proceeding under title 11 in one context may be unrelated in another”). The burden of demonstrating relatedness rests with the parties seeking to transfer the wrongful death cases to this Court. See Amoche v. Guarantee Trust Life Ins. Co., 556 F.3d 41, 48 (1st Cir.2009) (citing, in a Class Action Fairness Act case, the “basic principle” that the “party invoking federal jurisdiction has the burden of establishing that the court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case”); see also, e.g., Meritage Homes Corp. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 474 B.R. 526, 555 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 2012). If the Movants can establish that the wrongful death cases are “related to” the bankruptcy, then Section 157(b)(5) provides that this Court must determine the appropriate venue. Specifically, the statute provides: [t]he district court shall order that personal injury tort and wrongful death claims shall be tried in the district court in which the bankruptcy case is pending, or in the district court in the district in which the claim arose, as determined by the district court in which the bankruptcy case in pending. 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(5). Because the claims arose in Canada, if this Court finds bankruptcy relatedness jurisdiction, it could transfer the cases only to the District of Maine. DISCUSSION The Movants contend that the wrongful death cases are related to the Railway's bankruptcy and thus must be transferred to and tried in this district. The Movants assert four grounds for bankruptcy-relatedness jurisdiction. First, they claim that the Non–Debtor Defendants have claims for indemnity against the Railway such that recovery by the Claimants against the Non–Debtor Defendants would cause the Non–Debtor Defendants to seek repayment from the Estate. Second, CIT, Rail World, Rail World Locomotive Leasing, and Edward Burkhardt assert that claims against them are related to the Railway's bankruptcy because they share liability insurance with the Railway that is applicable to claims arising out of the disaster. Third, the Western Petroleum Defendants claim that resolution of the wrongful death suits may lead to a windfall for the Claimants if their cases are not consolidated and transferred to Maine. Finally, the Movants assert that centralization of the cases in the District of Maine will alleviate the burden on the Estate of duplicative discovery."
"Can utilities offset the amount of customer payments received by the debtor bill payment company during the preference period?","Edison contends that it is entitled to set off approximately $11,000 in new value it extended to the debtor and urges that the Court apply the “net result” rule. Section 547(c)(4) is not a reiteration of the “net result rule” employed under the prior Act which has been entirely supplanted by the formula under this section, which is more accurately referred to as “the subsequent advance rule”. In Re Gold Coast Seed Co., 30 B.R. 551, 10 B.C.D. 1049 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.1983). For Section 547(c)(4) to apply, three requirements must be met: the creditor must have extended the new value after receiving the preference; the new value must have been unsecured; and, the new value must remain unpaid. Matter of Bishop, 17 B.R. 180 (Bkrtcy.N.D.Ga.1982). Under this formula, the value of the utility service provided to the debtor after the preference payment for earlier service may be offset against the preference payment, as long as the new value remains unpaid. In Re Thomas W. Garland, Inc., 19 B.R. 920, 929 (Bkrtcy.E.D.Mo.1982); In Re Saco Local Dev. Corp., 30 B.R. 859, 10 B.C.D. 962 (Bkrtcy.D.Me.1983). In the present case, a review of defendant's Exhibits 2 and 3 shows that the amount of unsecured value of electricity extended to Keydata by Edison after the preference payments was $4876.48 and $578.97 for a total of $5455.50. This entire amount went unpaid. Having satisfied the elements of Section 547(c)(4), this amount may be offset against the total amount of preferences, $12,183.56, and judgment shall enter for the Plaintiff in the amount of $6728.11."
"Is a secured creditor's 9 day delay in returning a repossessed vehicle to the debtor considered a willful violation of the stay?","The evidence at trial demonstrates that Defendant Dill intentionally retained the Vehicle in violation of the automatic stay for four days after receiving notice of the Debtor's bankruptcy filing and then required payment from Debtor as a condition of the return of the Vehicle. See Weatherford, 413 B.R. at 287; Legrand v. Dep't of Hous. & Urban Dev. & I.R.S. (In re Legrand), No. 98–01921–W, Adv. Pro. No. 98–80166–W, 1999 WL 33486087 at *3–4 (Bankr.D.S.C. Mar. 8, 1999) (finding that the failure to rectify a violation of the stay once notified of the bankruptcy filing is a willful violation of the automatic stay); Ard v. Auto Acceptance (In re Ard), C/A No. 95–70839–D, Adv. Pro. No. 95–8051–D, slip. op. at 2 (Bankr.D.S.C. Mar. 5, 1996) (finding that a creditor who wrongly repossessed a vehicle post-petition willfully violated the automatic stay when he retained the vehicle despite notice of the bankruptcy case). Based on this evidence, the Court concludes that Defendant Dill's actions constituted a willful violation of the automatic stay."
"Can a license to use real property be rejected in the event of a bankruptcy?","In this case it is undisputed that the Debtor acquired rights in the liquor license under the terms of the lease of the Property, not a sale of the Property. Moreover, the Debtor's rights in the liquor license were coterminous with its rights in the Property under the lease. Although the Landlord transferred the license to the Debtor for nominal consideration of $1.00, there was no related sale of assets, and the Debtor did not acquire any ownership interest in the liquor license separate from the lease. Accordingly, to the extent that the Debtor's interest in the liquor license constitutes property of its bankruptcy estate under federal law, the scope of that interest is limited to a temporary privilege to use the license for the duration of the lease of the Property. No provision of the lease or applicable state law provides the Debtor with rights in the liquor license separate and distinct from its rights under the lease of the Property."
"Can a debtor assume a license agreement while rejecting other agreements with the licensor?","The parties' stated intent as expressed in the License Agreement and the Master Agreement compel this Court to conclude as a matter of law that the May 19 Agreements constitute a single contract. Consequently, the Bankruptcy Court erred by granting the Debtors' Motion to Assume and allowing the Debtors to assume the benefits of the License Agreement while rejecting the burdens of the Master Agreement.9 Having reached these conclusions, the Court will reverse the Bankruptcy Court and remand for further proceedings. The Court declines Huron's request to impose the terms of the Master Agreement upon the Debtors. Instead, on remand, the Debtors must now choose between rejecting or assuming the May 19 Agreements as one.10 The Court reiterates its above finding that Huron's right to terminate the License Agreement has lapsed. Thus, the parties should not misconstrue this Opinion as immediately terminating the Debtors' ability to use Huron's software; instead, it temporarily returns the parties to the post-confirmation status quo. The Bankruptcy Court must determine any remaining details on remand. V. CONCLUSION For the reasons explained above, the Bankruptcy Court's Opinion and Order granting the Debtors' motion to assume the Licensing Agreement and reject all other Agreements is REVERSED, and this matter is REMANDED for the Bankruptcy Court to proceed in a manner not inconsistent with this Court's Order."
"Is judgment debt resulting from injuries inflicted by a deliberate punch nondischargeable?","Plaintiffs seek a nondischargeability determination under § 523(a)(6) with respect to the debt owed by Defendant pursuant to the state court judgment. That subsection provides that a debt “for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity” is not dischargeable. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6). In order to be entitled to a judgment that the debt is excepted from discharge, Plaintiffs must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the injury from which the debt arises was both willful and malicious. Markowitz v. Campbell (In re Markowitz), 190 F.3d 455, 463 (6th Cir.1999); J & A Brelage, Inc. v. Jones (In re Jones), 276 B.R. 797, 801–2 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2001)."
"Can a debtor investment management firm's prepetition transfer of assets to one customer group at the expense of another be avoided?","The statute defines a settlement payment in a broad if rather circular manner as “a preliminary settlement payment, a partial settlement payment, an interim settlement payment, a settlement payment on account, a final settlement payment, or any other similar payment commonly used in the securities trade.” 11 U.S.C. § 741(8). We have held that swapping shares of a security for money (as happens in a customer redemption) is a settlement payment within the meaning of § 546(e). See Peterson, 729 F.3d at 749. Here, Sentinel's customers did not have rights to specific securities, but they were entitled to pro rata shares of the value of the securities in their groups' portfolios. That meant that Sentinel could finance customer redemptions by selling securities from their group's portfolio or by paying them with cash it had on hand. Regardless of how Sentinel chose to fund customer redemptions, the redemptions were meant to settle, at least partially, the customers' securities accounts with Sentinel. The pre-petition transfer to FCStone thus qualified as a “settlement payment” under § 546(e)."
"Is a trustee's motion to deny debtor a discharge timely when it is filed when debtor's Chapter 13 plan is near completion?","Rule 4004(a) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure governs the time for objecting to discharge in a bankruptcy case. That rule was amended, effective December 1, 2010, to provide in relevant part as follows: In a chapter 13 case, a motion objecting to the debtor's discharge under § 1328(f) shall be filed no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under § 341(a). At least 28 days' notice of the time so fixed shall be given to the United States trustee and all creditors as provided in Rule 2002(f) and (k) and to the trustee and the trustee's attorney. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 4004(a). Prior to Rule 4004(a) being amended, the rule contained no time constraint for filing a motion objecting to discharge under § 1328(f)."
"Is a  debtor entitled to discharge in a Chapter 13 case filed within four years of a prior Chapter 7 discharge?","The Court is further persuaded by those cases addressing this issue. See In re Knighton, 355 B.R. 922, 926 (Bankr.M.D.Ga.2006) (“plain reading of § 1328(f)(1) indicates that the lookback period runs from the filing date of the prior case to the filing date of the current case”); McDow v. Ratzlaff (In re Ratzlaff), 349 B.R. 443, 444 (Bankr.D.S.C.2006) (“Section 1328(f)(1) clearly provides that debtors in a chapter 13 case may not receive a discharge in their case when they received a discharge in a previous case and that previous case was filed within four years prior to the filing of the pending case”). See also In re McGhee, 342 B.R. 256, 258 (Bankr.W.D.Ky.2006) (“debtor who received a discharge in a Chapter 13 case filed within two years of the debtor filing a subsequent Chapter 13 petition may not receive a discharge in the second Chapter 13 case”) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, based on a plain reading of 11 U.S.C. § 1328(f), along with 11 U.S.C. §§ 301 and 302, the legislative history, and the relevant case law, it is clear that a debtor who received a discharge in a Chapter 7 case filed within four years of the debtor filing a subsequent Chapter 13 petition may not receive a discharge in the subsequent Chapter 13 case. In the present case, the debtor filed her prior Chapter 7 case more than four years before filing the current Chapter 13 petition, and therefore, 11 U.S.C. § 1328(f)(1) does not bar her from receiving a discharge, nor does it provide a basis for objecting to discharge. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Chapter 13 Trustee's objection to confirmation based on 11 U.S.C. § 1328 should be overruled."
"Can a federal farm agency amend a secured claim to reflect overpayment when the original claim did not reflect a right to setoff?","Mr. Noble's abandonment of the claims revests the claims with the debtor. Pilz Compact Disc, 229 B.R. at 638 (“Abandonment...removes property from the bankruptcy estate and returns the property to the debtor as though no bankruptcy occurred.”) (citations omitted). Upon abandonment, the Court's jurisdiction over the claims the debtor asserts in his adversary proceedings is limited. As set forth in Title 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b), “district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.” In Matter of Lemco Gypsum, Inc., 910 F.2d 784, 788 (11th Cir.1990), the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit adopted the test articulated in Pacor, Inc., v. Higgins, 743 F.2d 984, 994 (3rd Cir.1984), for determining whether a civil proceeding is sufficiently “related to” bankruptcy to confer federal jurisdiction. The appropriate test is “whether the outcome of the proceeding could conceivably have an effect on the bankruptcy estate” or alter the debtor's rights, liabilities, options, freedom of action, which in any way impact the administration of the estate. Lemco Gypsum, 910 F.2d at 788 (quoting 743 F.2d at 994). Based on the Pacor test, the Court easily can conclude it is without jurisdiction to hear the claims raised in the instant adversary proceedings. Again, the trustee has filed a report of no distribution, a notice of abandonment, and the debtor's discharge has issued. The resolution of these claims will not affect the debtor's estate or the allocation of assets among his creditors; any potential judgment amounts will not be administered by the Chapter 7 trustee or distributed to the debtor's creditors in this Chapter 7 case. “Where an asset has been abandoned by the Trustee, that asset is no longer a part of the bankruptcy estate.” In re Bray, 288 B.R. 305, 307 (Bankr.S.D.Ga.2001) (citation omitted). “As a result, the property reverts back to its pre-bankruptcy status, and that asset is properly removed from the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.” Id. (citing Dewsnup v. Timm (In re Dewsnup), 908 F.2d 588, 591 (10th Cir.1990) aff'd, 502 U.S. 410, 112 S.Ct. 773, 116 L.Ed.2d 903 (1992); accord, State v. Lange (In re Lange), 120 B.R. 132, 135 (9th Cir. BAP 1990), e.g.,  DeVore v. Marshack (In re DeVore), 223 B.R. 193, 200 (9th Cir. BAP 1998)). Thus, the debtor is now revested with the right to pursue his assorted claims against the various defendants in a more appropriate forum, if he chooses."
"Is a creditor that provided repair and maintenance services to a debtor oil and gas company entitled to administrative expense claim for work performed before and after the debtor was ordered to cease operations?","All of the $317,625.33 of Omega's pre-shut-in services are entitled to an administrative expense. Even under ATP's strict “benefit” standard, which requires Omega's goods and services to relate to the continuation of the business as a going concern, Omega's pre-shut-in work is entitled to an administrative expense."
"When will a decision for recharacterization of a creditor's claim from purported loan debt to equity investment be affirmed?","By my count, seven factors weigh in favor of recharacterization of the loans as investment equity, three factors in favor of treating the loans as debt, and three factors as neutral. Those factors favoring Mr. Jenkins largely concern the name and form of the promissory notes, and those against him concern the real-world backdrop behind the notes. Despite Mr. Jenkins's promissory-note forms suggesting debt, little else does. Mr. Jenkins entirely owned AFI and had it sign promissory notes it could not pay or hope to pay. Unlike with arms-length promissory notes, the object was not repayment, but instead was to protect Mr. Jenkins's 24 certificates of deposit from AFI's creditors and later to elevate his claims under the notes to a secured status. On balance, under these circumstances, the Hedged–Investments factors support the bankruptcy court's recharacterization of the loans as investment equity. In concluding otherwise, the majority relies on a policy of encouraging (or at least not discouraging) hypothetical business owners—unlike Mr. Jenkins—who lend their businesses money to keep them running in hopes of future profits. In this regard, the majority urges caution on grounds that “[w]e have been careful not to ‘discourage owners from trying to salvage a business' by requiring ‘all contributions to be made in the form of equity capital.’ ” Maj. Op. at 1153 (quoting In re Mid–Town Produce Terminal, Inc., 599 F.2d 389, 392 (10th Cir.1979)). Similarly, it notes that “[i]ndeed, owners may often be ‘the only party willing to make a loan to a struggling business,’ In re Dornier Aviation [(North America), Inc.], 453 F.3d [225,] 234 [ (4th Cir.2006) ], and needlessly punishing their efforts is neither ‘desirable as social policy’ nor required by our precedent. In re Mid–Town Produce, 599 F.2d at 392.” Maj. Op. at 1153. While those are sensible policies in those sorts of cases, this case does not fit that bill. Here, Mr. Jenkins was in no way lending to sustain or revive a struggling business. Giving him the benefit of policies assuming that he was doing so skews the Hedged–Investments analysis. Thus, I disagree with the majority that the “unique circumstances of this case” justify treating Mr. Jenkins's money advances as loans under Hedged–Investments. Maj. Op. at 1153. Instead, I believe that the actual circumstances here (Mr. Jenkins's advancing AFI money not to mine coal but instead to reclaim coal lands so Mr. Jenkins could obtain release of his certificates of deposit) favor recharacterizing the loans as equity investment."
"Will a debtor's alleged waiver of the homestead exemption prevent avoidance of a judgment lien impairing the exemption?","Reading 11 U.S.C. §§ 522(e) and (f)(1) together, I conclude that a judicial lienholder should be viewed as a “creditor that holds an unsecured claim” for purposes of 11 U.S.C. § 522(e). While this may seem initially counterintuitive, 11 U.S.C. § 522(f)(1)(A) operates “[n]otwithstanding any waiver of exemptions,” meaning that if a judicial lien hypothetically impairs the exemption, the lienholder's exemption waiver is unenforceable. If the judicial lien is not subject to avoidance under 11 U.S.C. § 522(f)(1)(A) because it does not impair an exemption, then the exemption waiver is irrelevant. Therefore, as a practical matter, there is no circumstance in which an exemption waiver in favor of a judicial lienholder would be enforceable under 11 U.S.C. § 522(e), but not 11 U.S.C. § 522(f)(1)(A). This result is also consonant with the legislative history and purpose of 11 U.S.C. §§ 522(e) and (f). Generally, the anti-waiver provisions represent a clear departure from the practice under the former Bankruptcy Act, where, so long as state law allowed, exemptions could be waived in favor of particular creditors by agreement.23 By enacting 11 U.S.C. § 522(e), Congress meant to “prevent frustration of the Bankruptcy Code by standard provisions in contracts of adhesion.” Taken as a whole, however, 11 U.S.C. § 522 preserves a debtor's fresh start by preventing a general unsecured creditor from elevating its status to that of a consensual lienholder simply by obtaining a judicial lien and a waiver of either an exemption or the avoidance power of 11 U.S.C. § 522(f)(1). For the above stated reasons, I conclude the Waiver is unenforceable. V. CONCLUSION In light of the foregoing, I will enter an order overruling the Objection."
"Can property that has been released from a mortgage be considered a fraudulent transfer if transferred to another entity within 100 days of mortgage foreclosure?","The Court does not see a clear pattern of fraud. When taken as a whole, Shallow's conduct with regards to the Debtor and its assets might appear suspect. Vista Bella was under Shallow's control from at least January 26, 2009 onward. Shallow failed to specifically foreclose on all of the Debtor's property and later profited from selling the property he had not clearly foreclosed. But no one attempted to redeem any of the property. No one inquired about redemption. Shallow thought RBL owned the LCEs. In retrospect, Shallow and RBL made a lot of money from Vista Bella while the Debtor's creditors all lost. One can agree that the fact pattern could be looked at both ways—that is why this trial occurred. However, the Court concludes that the Trustee did not prove the existence of a fraudulent scheme by a preponderance of the evidence.         The Court finds it very persuasive that Wilson and Shallow engaged in the same conduct with the Legacy Key project: Wilson was the developer. Shallow owned a unit. All the project's LCEs were appurtenant to Shallow's unit and Shallow reallocated them at Wilson's direction. Shallow did not profit from holding the LCEs; it was a mere convenience. Legacy Key was a successful project. Everyone made money; everyone was happy. Wilson and Shallow attempted to replicate their success with Vista Bella.         To this end, Shallow made roughly $50,000,000 in presales of Vista Bella units—a number that came very close to pro forma projections. He bought PH–1 as an investment. Then, in 2008, the housing market, along with the broader economy, tanked. One sale after another failed to close. Some purchasers demanded refunds of their deposits. The Debtor defaulted on its mortgage. Understandably, creditors became increasingly anxious and unwilling to provide lien releases, which further impeded sales efforts. Shallow's own investment in PH–1 was put at risk by these developments—developments which he certainly did not orchestrate.         In 2007 and 2008, Shallow may have thought that the housing market would improve and the Vista Bella project would turn a profit, but he could not have known that it would. In buying the Debtor's mortgage, he took a risk—a calculated risk, but a risk nonetheless. Several of the Debtor's creditors were interested in purchasing the mortgage, all with the hope or expectation that things would improve and money would be made. For one reason or another, these other creditors were not willing or able to buy the project. RBL was. Eventually, the market did improve, and Shallow's risk was rewarded. The Defendants actions are consistent with an effort to make the best business decision at each turn.         These facts together with the Court's view that the testimony of Wilson and the Shallows was credible makes it impossible to find that the Trustee met her burden of proof under either § 548 or § 544. Therefore, it is ordered and adjudged that all of the counts of the complaint of Lynn Harwell Andrews against the defendants RBL, L.L.C., Robert W. Shallow, Susan Shallow, and Ronald H. Carr are DENIED and judgment is awarded to the Defendants."
"Does the bankruptcy court have jurisdiction to interpret a sale order?","a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the district courts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title 11.  (b)   Except as provided in subsection (e)(2), and notwithstanding any Act of Congress that confers exclusive jurisdiction on a court or courts other than the district courts, the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.  (c)   (1)   Except with respect to a case under chapter 15 of title 11, nothing in this section prevents a district court in the interest of justice, or in the interest of comity with State courts or respect for State law, from abstaining from hearing a particular proceeding arising under title 11 or arising in or related to a case under title 11.  (2)   Upon timely motion of a party in a proceeding based upon a State law claim or State law cause of action, related to a case under title 11 but not arising under title 11 or arising in a case under title 11, with respect to which an action could not have been commenced in a court of the United States absent jurisdiction under this section, the district court shall abstain from hearing such proceeding if an action is commenced, and can be timely adjudicated, in a State forum of appropriate jurisdiction.  (d)   Any decision to abstain or not to abstain made under subsection (c) (other than a decision not to abstain in a proceeding described in subsection (c)(2)) is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section 158(d), 1291, or 1292 of this title or by the Supreme Court of the United States under section 1254 of this title. Subsection (c) and this subsection shall not be construed to limit the applicability of the stay provided for by section 362 of title 11, United States Code, as such section applies to an action affecting the property of the estate in bankruptcy.  (e)  The district court in which a case under title 11 is commenced or is pending shall have exclusive jurisdiction—  (1)   of all the property, wherever located, of the debtor as of the commencement of such case, and of property of the estate; and  (2)   over all claims or causes of action that involve construction of section 327 of title 11, United States Code, or rules relating to disclosure requirements under section 327."
"Can debtor confirm a Chapter 13 plan under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1325 where he included domestic support payments and mortgage payments under a ""second office"" that was actually an investment property?","In conclusion, payments for the Pgh. Rd. Property may not be deducted when calculating the Debtor's projected disposable income, because the Property is not reasonably necessary to the continuation of the Debtor's business and is not necessary for his support. Thus, the 2nd Amd. Plan does not provide for payments to unsecured creditors of all of the Debtor's projected disposable income and thereby does not meet the disposable income test. Therefore, the Court finds that the Debtor's 2nd Amd. Plan is not confirmable for that reason as well."
"Can debtor employ a law firm in a Chapter 11 action where the firm failed to comply with disclosure requirements and deadlines regarding payment and source of fees?","Counsel who ""fail to disclose timely and completely their connections proceed at their own risk because failure to disclose is sufficient grounds to revoke an employment order and deny compensation."" In re Am. Intern. Refinery, Inc., 676 F.3d 455, 465-66 (5th Cir. 2012). This is especially the case if the failure to disclose is intentional, since ""a bankruptcy court should punish a willful failure to disclose the connections required by Fed.R.Bankr.P. 2014 as severely as an attempt to put forth a fraud upon the court."" Crivello, 134 F.3d at 839. Ultimately, the bankruptcy court must ""gauge the ongoing interplay of factors and ... make the delicate judgment calls which such a decision entails."" 134 F.3d at 839."
"Can the bankruptcy court assert jurisdiction over a state law claim between debtor and a third party over funds held in escrow to ensure completion of debtor's services?","In sum, the bankruptcy court correctly concluded that the Escrowed Funds are not property of the estate and EST did not have a right to disbursement of the Escrowed Funds. The estate owned EST's right to assert a claim against Escrow Agent to enforce its contractual rights under the Escrow Agreement."
"Should a single asset real estate debtor's case be dismissed under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1112(b) as filed in bad faith intended to hinder and delay first lienholders?","Many of these factors are present here. Debtor holds a single asset; the Property. Debtor does not have employees; rather, those individuals employed at the Property work for Richfield. See TR, May 21, 2012 at 134 (TM of Burr). To the extent that Debtor's existence enables Richfield to employ approximately 160 people, it was Debtor's filing of bankruptcy that jeopardized those jobs. See Ex. 54. There appears to have been improper pre-petition conduct on the part of the Vestin Affiliates with regard to the creation of Debtor and observance by Debtor and the Vestin Affiliates of the requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Property had been posted for foreclosure, and Debtor filed bankruptcy on the eve of a hearing at which the TRO barring foreclosure might have been dissolved. The bulk (if not all) of the unsecured claims Debtor has scheduled are in fact debts owed by Richfield. Furthermore, where, as here, “a one-asset entity has been created or revitalized on the eve of foreclosure to isolate the insolvent property and its creditors,” the inference of bad faith is particularly strong. Little Creek, 779 F.2d at 1073; accord Trident, 52 F.3d at 131–32. The court infers that the primary purpose of placing the Property in Debtor was to isolate the Property and the problems associated with it from the other assets of Vestin and the Vestin Affiliates. See In re Thirtieth Place, Inc., 30 B.R. 503, 505–06 (9th Cir. BAP 1983) (finding “persuasive evidence of bad faith” where debtor was “created for the sole purpose of obtaining protection under the automatic stay by filing bankruptcy”)."
"Should creditor be granted relief from stay to pursue an appeal of attorneys' fee award in favor of debtor obtained through plaintiff debtor's lawsuit?","Therefore, it is ORDERED that Dr. Judy Baack's Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(d) (docket #62) is GRANTED."
"Is student loan debt properly classified as priority debt under 11 U.S.C.S. § 507 for purposes of determining presumption of abuse under the Means Test?","Although not relevant in this matter, it is noted that, while they are generally nondischargeable debts, student-loan obligations are not actually priority debts under the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. § 507 (listing priority debts); 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8) (providing for nondischargeability of student loans)."
"Should an involuntary bankruptcy petition be dismissed for bad faith and futility where debtor has a fiduciary duty to the estate and can operate profitably?","The Astros' futility argument turns “bad faith” law on its head. It is true that the petitioning creditors may not sustain an involuntary chapter 11 bankruptcy petition if a chapter 11 case would be futile. In this case (and contrary to the evidentiary record), the Astros now argue that the Astros, by exercising veto rights through its appointed director, can render any hope of reorganization to be futile. In this case, the alleged “futility” arises only because of the Astros' unsupported threats to cause a director to breach his duties. The Court is unaware of any case law that would support a dismissal based on futility that is engineered by the party seeking the dismissal. Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this Memorandum Opinion, the Court concludes: • The Network owns valuable assets. • There is a reasonable possibility that the Network can operate profitably. • The Network's managers have fiduciary duties to the Estate. • In exercising their fiduciary duties, the Network's managers will act to promote the Debtor's long-term profitable operation. • The Network's reorganization is far from futile, and there are substantial financial interests to protect. • The original involuntary petition was not filed in bad faith. • The three creditors who later joined the involuntary petition did not join in bad faith. Under these circumstances, the Court must enter relief against the Houston Regional Sports Network, L.P."
"Can debtor's counsel defend his fee application as reasonable to the court by citing that it took approximately 20 hours to prepare debtor's bankruptcy petition?","The Court does not make light of Attorney Aframe's provision of these services to the Debtor. After all, as Abraham Lincoln famously said, “A lawyer's time and advice are his stock in trade.” But an attorney's charges for services rendered must be qualitatively based on the existing circumstances. The Court sees no need here to quarrel with Attorney Aframe's hourly rate. But for these relatively simple services, consuming (according to his attached time records) a startling and unjustifiable approximate 20 hours, Attorney Aframe requests fees in an amount equal to what lawyers typically charge their clients in full for uncomplicated Chapter 13 cases. As such, the Court finds that the request is patently unreasonable. The Court will allow compensation for these services in the sum of $750—an amount which the Court believes is the reasonable value of the services rendered."
"Does a debtor lack good faith if it objects to a proof of claim regarding a debt that has been scheduled?","Cach, LLC attached a Rider to each of its claims that fully complies with these requirements. Therefore, the Debtors have no basis to argue that the creditor failed to comply with Rule 3001(c). Further, the Debtors' objections to Claim Nos. 5, 6, and 7 are not good faith objections because the debts listed in these claims were scheduled as undisputed by the Debtors in amounts (rounded to the nearest dollar) identical to the amounts asserted by the creditor in its proofs of claim. More than ten years ago, this Court issued its opinion in In re Moreno, 341 B.R. 813, 817 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 2006) (""Moreno"") holding that the failure to attach sufficient documentation to proofs of claim for credit card debts was not, by itself, a basis for disallowing unsecured credit card claims. Moreover, the Court specifically criticized the tactic of filing an objection to an undisputed scheduled claim stating that ""if a debt is scheduled... for an amount equal to or exceeding the amount in the proof of claim, this Court will not tolerate attempts to obtain orders disallowing these claims if the only basis for the objection is lack of documentation. Moreno, 341 B.R. at 819. In a later decision from this district, Judge Olson followed Moreno and went a step further sanctioning debtor's counsel for filing objections to scheduled claims based solely on lack of documentation. In re Velez, 465 B.R. 912 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 2012). This Court is not imposing sanctions but Debtors' counsel is admonished not to file similar objections in the future."
"When will a bankruptcy order finding that a Chapter 11 debtor's time to assume or reject a franchise agreement be stayed pending resolution of an appeal of a district court's decision on the merits?","The issue for us on this appeal, however, is slightly different. A & F and IHOP fought this legal battle in bankruptcy court, and A & F lost on the merits. The bankruptcy judge issued orders deeming the building leases rejected and the franchise agreements and equipment leases expired. A & F appealed this decision to the district court. A & F also sought a stay pending appeal, which both the bankruptcy court and the district court denied. Both courts thought that A & F's position lacked merit because the text of § 365(d)(4) contains no exception for leases tied to franchises. A & F filed this appeal seeking review of the district court's order denying the stay and also moved for an emergency stay. We granted the emergency motion and issued a stay order freezing the status quo during the pendency of this appeal. The sole issue for us now is whether the bankruptcy court's orders should be stayed pending resolution of the appeal on the merits, which remains pending before the district court. We find that a continued stay is warranted. I. The standard for granting a stay pending appeal mirrors that for granting a preliminary injunction. In re Forty–Eight Insulations, Inc., 115 F.3d 1294, 1300 (7th Cir.1997). Stays, like preliminary injunctions, are necessary to mitigate the damage that can be done during the interim period before a legal issue is finally resolved on its merits. The goal is to minimize the costs of error. See Stuller, Inc. v. Steak N Shake Enters., Inc., 695 F.3d 676, 678 (7th Cir.2012); Roland Mach. Co. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 388 (7th Cir.1984). To determine whether to grant a stay, we consider the moving party's likelihood of success on the merits, the irreparable harm that will result to each side if the stay is either granted or denied in error, and whether the public interest favors one side or the other. See Cavel Int'l, Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F.3d 544, 547–48 (7th Cir.2007); Sofinet v. INS, 188 F.3d 703, 706 (7th Cir.1999); In re Forty–Eight Insulations, 115 F.3d at 1300. As with a motion for a preliminary injunction, a “sliding scale” approach applies; the greater the moving party's likelihood of success on the merits, the less heavily the balance of harms must weigh in its favor, and vice versa. Cavel, 500 F.3d at 547–48; Sofinet, 188 F.3d at 707. An unusual twist here is that the stay issue comes to us in the context of a bankruptcy appeal to the district court. But our jurisdiction is secure under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a). See In re Forty–Eight Insulations, 115 F.3d at 1300. The district judge denied the stay after concluding that A & F was not likely to succeed on the merits; although other aspects of a stay decision are reviewed deferentially, this is a legal conclusion that we review de novo. Id. at 1301."
"Should a Chief Restructuring Officer's fee of $2 million for several complex chapter 11 cases be permitted as reasonable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 330?","“Courts in the Second Circuit have adopted a ‘market-driven’ approach in which the cost of comparable services is a significant factor in determining reasonableness of fees.” XO Commc'ns, Inc. (XO Commc'ns I ), 323 B.R. 330, 343 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2005) (citing Ames Dep't Stores, 76 F.3d at 71 (noting that when Congress enacted section 330, it took “the position that ‘compensation in bankruptcy matters be commensurate with the fees awarded in non-bankruptcy cases' ”); In re Bennett Funding Grp., Inc., 213 B.R. 234, 250 (Bankr.N.D.N.Y.1997) (stating that courts should rely on the “ ‘market’ of comparable legal services to assist in determining the level of compensation to be awarded”)). Courts in other circuits also consider market practices when determining reasonableness of fees under section 330. See In re United Artists Theatre Co. v. Walton, 315 F.3d 217, 229 (3d Cir.2003) (section 330 “takes a ‘market-driven’ approach”); Zolfo, Cooper & Co. v. Sunbeam–Oster Co., Inc., 50 F.3d 253, 258 (3d Cir.1995) (same); In re Busy Beaver Bldg. Ctrs., Inc., 19 F.3d 833, 852 (3d Cir.1994) (same); In re Insilco Techs., Inc., 291 B.R. 628, 633–34 (Bankr.D.Del.2003) (stating that “we have recognized that § 330, which deals with what constitutes ‘reasonable’ compensation for professionals, takes a ‘market-driven’ approach”). The Debtors have provided evidence that the $2.0 million Success Fee is well within market standards, considering the Debtors' asset size, amount of liabilities, and the measure of value creation, and savings, to the estates. (See generally Dempsey Decl.; Nolan Decl.) The UST challenges the evidence presented on the grounds that (1) comparisons between fees awarded to firms are not relevant here because the proposed Success Fee will go to an individual and (2) Kruger did not act substantially as CEO, making the Debtors' consideration of cases where the CROs assumed CEO duties flawed. The Court disagrees on both counts. First, the UST asserts that Mercer's analysis of recent bankruptcy cases did not yield acceptable market comparisons because the success fees in those cases were paid to firms rather than to individuals. The Debtors established that Mercer considered a variety of factors to determine which market variables were most important to determining success fee awards and concluded that the Success Fee “ought to reflect the value of the contribution rather than the amount of human resources assigned to the engagement because the empirical correlation between team size and success fee was weaker than the link between asset size and success fee.” (Reply ¶ 16.) Finding no other case in this district with comparable facts, the Debtors and their professionals considered a variety of recent “mega Chapter 11 cases” to determine the market comparison most appropriate for the Success Fee. (Id. ¶17; see also Dempsey Decl. ¶ 13.) The analyses conducted showed that the proposed $2.0 million Success Fee is comparable in amount to the market rate as determined by the large sample of cases considered by Mercer and FTI. (Reply ¶ 17 (citing Dempsey Decl. and Nolan Decl.).) The UST further challenges the Debtors' assertion that Kruger acted as more than just the CRO after Thomas Marano resigned as CEO, thereby justifying a higher success fee based upon market analysis. But the Debtors cite Kruger's contributions by wearing multiple hats as one of many factors informing their decision regarding the amount of the award. That Kruger filled more than one role is only one of many factors the Debtors listed in support of the Motion. How many hours Kruger spent on his expanded responsibilities does not determine the outcome on this Motion. Even removing from consideration the five cases Mercer analyzed that involved CROs performing CEO duties, the median compensation was $1.75 million and the 75th percentile was $2.2 million. (Dempsey Decl. ¶ 14.) The $2.0 million Success Fee falls within that range. Kruger was not a traditional CRO. The biggest hurdles in this case, after a majority of the Debtors' assets were successfully sold at auction, were billions of dollars of litigation claims, including the RMBS trusts' claims, borrower claims, government regulators' claims, and securities claims. A professional with Kruger's background and experience was needed to help work towards a resolution of those claims. Though the UST argues that Kruger acted “essentially like a legal advisor to the debtors,” Kruger was not retained under section 327 of the Bankruptcy Code. He was retained, and acted, as the CRO to the Debtors, and the reasonableness of his Success Fee is properly considered under section 330. Based on a careful review of the services Kruger performed, the results achieved, and the uncontroverted evidence of market rates, the Court finds that Kruger's proposed $2.0 million Success Fee is reasonable."
"Is creditor's counsel entitled to recover an administrative expense claim under 11 U.S.C.S. § 503(b)(4) for fees incurred working on a proposed plan?","Based on the foregoing, I conclude that Berlack is entitled to a substantial contribution award for the services it rendered in connection with its work on the disclosure statement, the plan and the related settlements discussed above. In light of the Goldin Statement, Berlack may also be entitled to an award to the extent that its review of the Kidder liquidations led the trustee to discover additional bonds and assert corresponding claims. Berlack must first identify its services, and explain how and to what extent the assertion of these claims led to a reduction in Kidder's allowable claims under its settlement with the trustee. In all other respects, its application is denied. Berlack Firm may submit a revised application which presents the time records that correspond to those services and expenses that are allowable on a substantial contribution basis as outlined above."
"Is the one-year lookback in § 727(a)(2)(A) subject to equitable tolling?","Plainly, the statute itself—unlike other Code provisions—does not expressly provide for tolling. Cf. 11 U.S.C. § 108(c) (2000) (extending statutes of limitation for creditors when the automatic stay bars their collection efforts). Notwithstanding this plain language, Tidewater argues that tolling applies here because of the principle that statutes of limitation are “customarily subject to ‘equitable tolling,’ ” Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,498 U.S. 89, 95, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990), unless tolling would be “inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.” United States v. Beggerly, 524 U.S. 38, 48, 118 S.Ct. 1862, 141 L.Ed.2d 32 (1998)."
"Can a Chapter 13 debtor amend a claim of exemption after the plan is confirmed to include an exemption that could have been claimed prior to confirmation?","As with the debtors in Wolfberg, the Debtors here did not claim the Vacant Lot as exempt prior to confirmation. Because they could have done so prior to confirmation, the res judicata effect of the Confirmation Order bars them from claiming that exemption now. The court in Wolfberg noted in dicta that the few cases which held that a Chapter 13 debtor can amend schedules post-confirmation to add exemptions did not discuss the interplay between Rule 1009(a) and § 1327(a). In fact, the courts in In re Dodd and Combs v. Combs merely address a debtor's ability to amend Schedule F to add unsecured creditors post-confirmation. And the court in In re Tippins17 held that a debtor who amended schedules, post-confirmation, to add causes of action and to exempt those causes of action, had standing to prosecute the causes of action, primarily because no party had objected to the amended claim of exemption. This Court, like Wolfberg, does not find those cases relevant to the issue at hand. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that by operation of § 1327(a), the Debtors may not amend their claim of exemption to include an exemption that could have been claimed prior to confirmation. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Chapter 13 Trustee's objections to the Debtors' amended claims of exemption are SUSTAINED."
"In what circumstances, if any, can a client protect his assets from his spouse in California?","All parties acknowledge that California is a community property state and that, in the absence of a supervening agreement between the spouses, each spouse owns an undivided one-half interest in all property acquired during the marriage. Prenuptial agreements are covered by the statute of frauds, which means that they must be in writing. It is not impossible for an oral prenuptial agreement to be deemed valid and binding, but it is extremely difficult, and the standard for recognizing a prenuptial agreement in the absence of a writing is very high. The bankruptcy court found that ""the Wahls had some sort of premarital understanding,"" but whatever that understanding was, it did not meet the high burden that the law requires for enforceability against third parties. In their briefs and in their arguments, the Wahls fundamentally misunderstand and misconstrue prenuptial agreements, the statute of frauds, and the reasons for the requirement that such agreements must be in writing. They contend that the issue of oral prenuptial agreements usually arises in divorce cases, where the divorcing spouses typically disagree with each other about whether they had a premarital agreement and what it provided. The Wahls note that the current case is not a divorce proceeding, and, in fact, they say, the spouses agree that there was a prenuptial agreement and what its terms were. In their view, the fact that they agree should end the inquiry, and no one, including the chapter 7 trustee, has standing to challenge what the spouses say they verbally agreed to before the marriage.         Their argument is just plain wrong. While it may be true that the issue of an oral prenuptial agreement usually arises in the context of a divorce, that is not the only context in which it may arise or in which it matters. In a bankruptcy proceeding, under § 541(a)(2), the debtor's estate includes all of the debtor's and the nonfiling spouse's interests in community property. Given this interest, creditors are entitled to a full accounting of a debtor's assets, which may very well be affected by the presence or absence of a valid prenuptial agreement that purports to determine whether property is community or separate property. A valid prenuptial agreement overriding a state's community property law would prevent creditors from gaining access to half of the assets of the nondebtor spouse. But if there is no such agreement, all such property would be community property, and it would become part of the debtor spouse's bankruptcy estate under § 541(a)(2)."
"How often can a debtor file for bankruptcy?","(a) The court shall grant the debtor a discharge, unless—  … (8) the debtor has been granted a discharge under this section, under section 1141 of this title, or under section 14, 371, or 476 of the Bankruptcy Act, in a case commenced within 8 years before the date of the filing of the petition; (9) the debtor has been granted a discharge under section 1228 or 1328 of this title, or under section 660 or 661 of the Bankruptcy Act, in a case commenced within six years before the date of the filing of the petition, unless payments under the plan in such case totaled at least—  (A)100 percent of the allowed unsecured claims in such case; or (B)(i) 70 percent of such claims; and (ii) the plan was proposed by the debtor in good faith, and was the debtor’s best effort;"
"Can a Chapter 13 debtor amend a claim of exemption after the plan is confirmed to include an exemption that could have been claimed prior to confirmation?","The Court's conclusion rests upon the interplay of § 1327(a) with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1009. That rule states in relevant part that a ""schedule . . . may be amended by the debtor as a matter of course at any time before the case is closed."" Absent a showing of bad faith or prejudice to creditors, courts routinely permit debtors to amend their claim of exemption. But, as addressed by the court in [Citation omitted] there is a difference between exercising the right to amend exemptions under Rule 1009 and actually being entitled to the exemption claimed in the amendment. The procedural right to amend is subordinate to the substantive res judicata effect of a confirmation order."
"Should the court dismiss Chapter 13 debtor's adversary proeeding to avoid a prepetition foreclosure where debtor's rights were extinguished prepetition?","Any purchaser of the Property, as of the commencement of this case, would be charged with notice of the public record, which includes any properly recorded instruments. As of the commencement of the Cerrato's bankruptcy, the public record included the Foreclosure Judgment, the notice of pendency, and the Referee's Report of Sale. SeeMosello, 190 B.R. at 170 (“[A] bona fide purchaser under New York law would have been required to examine the entire public record and would have discovered the foreclosure judgment....”). These recorded instruments would charge any subsequent purchaser with the information contained in them. Fairmont Funding, 301 A.D.2d at 564, 754 N.Y.S.2d 54 (“The intended purchaser must be presumed to have investigated the title, and to have examined every deed or instrument properly recorded, and to have known every fact disclosed or to which an inquiry suggested by the record would have led.”). The Foreclosure Judgment provides a purchaser with notice that a foreclosure sale was authorized by the court, and at a minimum would require a purchaser to inquire whether a foreclosure sale had occurred. SeeIn re Davidson Rehab Associates, 103 B.R. 440, 444 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.1989) (holding that a would-be bona fide purchaser could not simply ignore the recorded notices of an impending non-judicial foreclosure sale and fail to make inquiry as to whether the announced sale had occurred). Furthermore, here the Referee's Report of Sale provided express notice that a foreclosure sale had been conducted and that BAC was the winning bidder. (BAC's Mot. to Dismiss Ex. J, Adv. Pro. No 13–01138–CEC, ECF No. 10). Because a bona fide purchaser would have notice of the Foreclosure Judgment, the notice of pendency, and the Referee's Report of Sale at the time Cerrato's bankruptcy petition was filed, Cerrato is unable to avoid the Foreclosure Judgment and subsequent sale through § 544(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code."
"Should the court grant chapter 11 debtor's competitor relief from stay and remand allowing a lawsuit to be filed that could materially affect value of debtor's business?","The Court finds and concludes that, among all the factors for abstention, the paramount concern is that the dispute between the parties cannot be adjudicated in the Court of Common Pleas without substantial harm and delay to this bankruptcy proceeding and to Debtor's attempts to pay its creditors, preserve employment for a large workforce and continue to provide vital defense-related services. For these reasons, the Court denies the Motions to Remand and for Relief from Stay."
"Can trustee bring a preferential transfer proceeding against a non-creditor transferee who acted as a mere conduit between debtor and financial company?","The Bankruptcy Code defines “creditor” as “[an] entity that has a claim against the debtor that arose at the time of or before the order for relief concerning the debtor[,]” 11 U.S.C. § 101(10)(A) (2006), and defines “claim” as: (A) [a] right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured; or (B) [a] right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured. 11 U.S.C. § 101(5) (2006). As clearly defined by the Preauthorized Withdrawal Form and Agreement, Prudential Financial, and not the Defendant, held a right to payment of any retroactive benefit awarded the Debtor, which was to be repaid to Prudential Financial in accordance with the terms of the Debtor's disability benefit plan. Similarly, the Appointment of Representative form expressly provided that any fee owed to the Defendant was to be paid by a third party, i.e., Prudential Financial. The Defendant was merely the conduit between the Debtor and Prudential Financial and was never owed anything by the Debtor. The arguments advanced by the Defendant in its Memorandum of Law in Support of the Motion to Dismiss concerning Prudential Financial's role as a plan administrator and a fully secured creditor would apply only to an adversary proceeding by the Plaintiff against Prudential Financial and have no real application with respect to this adversary proceeding. The Defendant's role, as defined by the Appointment of Representative form and the Preauthorized Withdrawal Form and Agreement, was to act on the Debtor's behalf in negotiating with the Social Security Administration, to procure a benefit award for the Debtor, and to subsequently transfer any reimbursement of funds previously paid by Prudential Financial from the Debtor's account back to Prudential Financial, with any fees due the Defendant to be paid by Prudential Financial. None of those actions transform the Defendant into an entity that had a claim against the Debtor; instead, the party holding a claim against the Debtor was Prudential Financial. Based upon the record and taking the Complaint in a light most favorable to the Plaintiff and accepting the allegations as true, the court finds that the Defendant is not a creditor of the Debtor and, therefore, did not receive more than it would have in a Chapter 7 case had the transfer not occurred. Accordingly, although the court agrees with the Plaintiff that he has pled enough facts that the court could draw a reasonable inference that a preferential transfer took place, because he has not sought to recover from the creditor to whose benefit the transfer was made, the Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted against the Defendant, and the Motion to Dismiss filed by the Defendant shall be granted. An Order consistent with this Memorandum will be entered."
"Should the court dismiss an appeal of order for sale of debtor's assets as moot under 11 U.S.C. § 363(m) where movant failed to rebut trustee's arguments that relief not affecting validity of the sale order was unavailable?","Unlike ANR, Hiawatha did request relief below that would not affect the validity of the sale order. But before this court, Hiawatha does not rebut Rushton's arguments showing that such relief is not available to Hiawatha. Therefore, although we disagree with the district court's reasons for finding Hiawatha's appeal moot, we agree that the appeal is in fact moot under § 363(m)."
"Should the court dismiss Chapter 11 cases filed in bad faith under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1112(b) or is there sufficient cause to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee?","As previously explained by this court in In re Sydnor, 431 B.R. 584 (Bankr.D.Md.2010) (Keir, C.J.), the statutory construction of Section 1112 is fairly complex and may require the court to apply a burden shifting analysis in its determination of a motion brought under this section. A movant bears the initial burden to establish cause for dismissal or conversion. If cause is established, the court must dismiss the case or convert the case to a Chapter 7, whichever is in the best interests of the estate and creditors, or appoint a Chapter 11 trustee if the court instead finds that such appointment is the best interests of creditors and the estate. Cause is not precisely defined in the statute, but Section 1112(b)(4) contains a non-exclusive list of enumerated examples of facts that would constitute cause. Further, courts have determined that “bad faith” is also a basis for dismissal or conversion. Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 1112.04 [4]–[7] (Henry Somers & Alan Resnick, 16th ed. 2009)."
"Is debtor's attorney entitlted to lodestar fee where he had certified prior to confirmation that he would not seek fees in excess of the maximum base fee?","In summary, Local Rule 2016–1 provides a Chapter 13 debtor's attorney with two options: the attorney may charge the Base Fee not to exceed $3,000.00 or may use the Lodestar rate and seek compensation by filing a fee application conforming to Rule 2016(a) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. Here, Mayer & Newton charged the maximum Base Fee of $3,000.00. As discussed, Mayer & Newton certified in their Compensation Disclosure Statement filed on August 15, 2013, that “I will not charge any additional amount for any services rendered or expenses incurred prior to confirmation of the chapter 13 plan [.]” Notwithstanding that the Statement of Services attached as Exhibit A to the Application for Compensation evidences that the services rendered by Mayer & Newton might justify a fee of $6,855.00, they cannot now switch to a different fee arrangement with the Debtor. The court finds troubling the contradiction in the Compensation Disclosure Statement that the “compensation ... agreed to be paid to [Mayer & Newton], for services rendered ... in connection with this chapter 13 case is ... $3,000.00,” with the certification in the Application for Compensation that “[t]he Debtor's fee agreement allows for fees based on a time basis at the rate of $250.00 per hour for services rendered in this case.” Mayer & Newton cannot have it both ways. The maximum fee to which Mayer & Newton is entitled is $3,000.00. Mayer & Newton, having filed the Application for Compensation within the time directed by the December 10, 2013 Dismissal Order, and because they are clearly entitled to a fee in excess of the $1,250.00 fixed by that order, the court directs that they are allowed an attorney fee in the amount of $3,000.00 of which $1,500.00 has already been paid. The Chapter 13 Trustee is authorized to remit from funds remaining in her possession the additional sum of $1,500.00 to Mayer & Newton."
"Is it a violation of the automatic stay to impose the default rate of interest on a loan based on a post-petition default by debtor?","While we agree with the district court that payments after the December 2013 effective date of the plan should reflect a seven percent rate of interest, we disagree with its holding that a five percent rate of interest should apply to payments calculated between September 16, 2013, and December 2013. The district court based this conclusion on the premise that the default rate of interest was a ""disjunctive alternative remedy"" to acceleration and foreclosure. J.A. 71. That, however, is not a plausible construction of the promissory note.         Under the district court's view, the debtors might incur the default rate of interest, maintain payments thereon for a decade or more, and then suddenly experience a five percent rate of interest upon further default and acceleration. We are doubtful that the parties would have expected this outcome. While the text of the note admittedly labels acceleration ""[a]s an alternative to an increase in interest rate,"" J.A. 27, that does not answer the question. In our view, the ""alternative"" of acceleration was a more-severe sanction that would likely be invoked only after the less-severe default rate of interest had failed. Nothing in the contract indicates that the parties intended for its invocation to unravel the earlier, less-severe remedy.         All post-petition interest payments, including those from September 16, 2013 through December 2013, should therefore reflect the parties' negotiated seven percent default rate of interest. The bankruptcy court, which affirmed the plan as modified to reflect a seven percent rate of interest for arrearage accrued from June 1, 2013 through September 16, 2013, and which required that all post-petition mortgage payments reflect the seven percent default interest rate, had it right.         We accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court insofar as it required that post-petition interest payments be calculated using the seven percent default rate of interest, but we reverse that part of the judgment which applied only a five percent rate of interest to payments calculated ""for the period between September 16, 2013 and the December 2013, effective date of the plan."" We remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion."
"When does a debtor need to hire a consumer privacy ombudsman?","(a)   If a hearing is required under section 363(b)(1)(B), the court shall order the United States trustee to appoint, not later than 7 days before the commencement of the hearing, 1 disinterested person (other than the United States trustee) to serve as the consumer privacy ombudsman in the case and shall require that notice of such hearing be timely given to such ombudsman.  (b)  The consumer privacy ombudsman may appear and be heard at such hearing and shall provide to the court information to assist the court in its consideration of the facts, circumstances, and conditions of the proposed sale or lease of personally identifiable information under section 363(b)(1)(B). Such information may include presentation of—  (1)   the debtor’s privacy policy;  (2)   the potential losses or gains of privacy to consumers if such sale or such lease is approved by the court;  (3)   the potential costs or benefits to consumers if such sale or such lease is approved by the court; and  (4)   the potential alternatives that would mitigate potential privacy losses or potential costs to consumers.

"How does a spouses' bankruptcy affect the other spouse in North Carolina?","(b)For purposes of this section: (1)""Marital property"" means all real and personal property acquired by either spouse or both spouses during the course of the marriage and before the date of the separation of the parties, and presently owned, except property determined to be separate property or divisible property in accordance with subdivision (2) or (4) of this subsection. Marital property includes all vested and nonvested pension, retirement, and other deferred compensation rights, and vested and nonvested military pensions eligible under the federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act. It is presumed that all property acquired after the date of marriage and before the date of separation is marital property except property which is separate property under subdivision (2) of this subsection. It is presumed that all real property creating a tenancy by the entirety acquired after the date of marriage and before the date of separation is marital property. Either presumption may be rebutted by the greater weight of the evidence."
"In the Ninth Circuit, what is the standard for withdrawal of the reference for cause?","Withdrawal is permissive “for cause shown.” 28 U.S.C. § 157(d); [Citation omitted]. To determine whether cause for permissive withdrawal exists, a district court “should first evaluate whether the claim is core or non-core, since it is upon this issue that questions of efficiency and uniformity will turn.” [Citation omitted]. Next, the “district court should consider the efficient use of judicial resources, delay and costs to the parties, uniformity of bankruptcy administration, the prevention of forum shopping, and other related factors.” [Citation omitted]. “It is within a district court's discretion to grant or deny a motion for permissive withdrawal of reference; that decision will not be disturbed unless the court abuses its discretion.” [Citation omitted]."
"Is the two year look-back period for nondischargeable tax debt a limitations period subject to equitable tolling?","Although the debtor claims that these characteristics are lacking in the two-year period of § 523(a)(1)(B)(ii), this court disagrees. To the contrary, many of the considerations that led the Supreme Court in Young to determine that the three-year lookback period of §§ 523(a)(1)(A) and 507(a)(8)(a)(i) was a limitations period also are present here. In Young, the Court noted: The lookback period is a limitations period because it prescribes a period within which certain rights (namely, priority and nondischargeability in bankruptcy) may be enforced.... Old tax claims—those pertaining to returns due more than three years before the debtor filed the bankruptcy petition—become dischargeable, so that a bankruptcy decree will relieve the debtor of the obligation to pay. The period thus encourages the IRS to protect its rights—by, say, collecting the debt ... or perfecting a tax lien ... before three years have elapsed. If the IRS sleeps on its rights, its claim loses priority and the debt becomes dischargeable. Thus, as petitioners concede, the lookback period serves the same “basic policies [furthered by] all limitations provisions: repose, elimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff's opportunity for recovery and a defendant's potential liabilities.” Young, 535 U.S. at 47, 122 S.Ct. 1036 (alteration in original) (citations omitted) (quoting Rotella v. Wood, 528 U.S. 549, 555, 120 S.Ct. 1075, 145 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2000)). The same can be said of the two-yearlookbackperiod of § 523(a)(1)(B)(ii). The two-yearlookbackperiod provides the IRS with a specified time period within which it must pursue its claim and preserve its rights. Because liability for untimely tax returns will be discharged if the return was filed more than twoyears before the bankruptcy petition, it encourages the IRS to collect on the debt or perfect its lien before the two-yearperiod expires. If the IRS neglects its claim, the taxdebt becomes dischargeable. The noted policies of repose, elimination of stale claims and certainty are all present. The two-yearlookbackperiod also satisfies the requirement identified in Tidewater that the limitationsperiod must commence when the plaintiff has (or discovers that he has) a complete and present cause of action. The limitationperiod of the two-year rule commences when the debtor files an untimely tax return because the debt becomes dischargeable if a petition is filed more the twoyears after the untimely return is filed. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(B)(ii). The time the return is filed is also when the IRS is put on notice that it has a complete and present cause of action. Because liability for a tax return that is never filed is not dischargeable, the IRS has little incentive to attempt to collect on the debt until after a return is filed. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(B)(I). SeeIn re Greenstein, 95 B.R. 583, 585 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1989) (“Until that return is filed, the taxing authority cannot be expected to take action to assess or collect the tax.”). Although the debtor argues that, under the three-year rule, the IRS has a complete and present cause of action when the return is actually due, seeTidewater, 498 F.3d at 255, the fact that the two-year rule and the three-year rule have limitationsperiods that commence at different moments was specifically addressed by the Supreme Court in Young, which stated: And the [three-year] lookback [period] is not distinctly substantive merely because it commences on a date that may precede the date when the IRS discovers its claim. There is nothing unusual about a statute of limitations that commences when the claimant has a complete and present cause of action, whether or not he is aware of it.... As for petitioners' reliance on § 523(a)(1)(B)(ii), that section proves, at most, that Congress put different limitationsperiods on different kinds of taxdebts.... Even if a taxdebt falls outside the terms of the [three-year] lookbackperiod, it is nonetheless nondischargeable if it pertains to an untimely return filed within twoyears before the bankruptcy petition. § 523(a)(1)(B)(ii). These provisions are complementary; they do not suggest that the lookbackperiod is something other than a limitationperiod. Young, 535 U.S. at 49, 122 S.Ct. 1036. As indicated by the Court in Young, the two-year rule and the three-year rule are complementary, even if they have different lookbackperiods. Both serve the same function; namely, they provide the IRS with a window within which it can reasonably expect to collect on the debt or perfect a lien, yet they also preserve a debtor's right to a “fresh start” when those same tax claims go unpursued, whether the debt is for untimely filed returns or tax liability for returns due within the three years preceding a petition. SeeIn re Stoll, 132 B.R. at 785. Because the two-yearperiod commences when the IRS discovers it has a complete and present cause of action, the statutory period found in § 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) satisfies the requirements of Tidewater and is subjecttoequitabletolling."
"Is a creditor holding a state court judgment for actual fraud by debtor entitled to a nondischargeable claim by virtue of collateral estoppel?","Whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion applies in a bankruptcy case is determined by state law. Sartin v. Macik, 535 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2008), Pahlavi v. Ansari (In re Ansari), 113 F.3d 17, 19 (4th Cir.1997). Application of the doctrine in Virginia “precludes parties to a prior action and their privies from litigating in a subsequent action any factual issue that actually was litigated and was essential to a valid, final judgment in the prior action.” TransDulles Center, Inc. v. Sharma, 252 Va. 20, 22–23, 472 S.E.2d 274, 275 (1996) (citations omitted). In TransDulles, the Supreme Court of Virginia held that for collateral estoppel to apply under Virginia law, the parties to the two proceedings ... must be the same; the factual issue sought to be litigated actually must have been litigated in the prior action and must have been essential to the prior judgment; and the prior action must have resulted in a valid, final judgment against the party sought to be precluded in the present action.

"When may a trustee recover unauthorized transfers made after the order for relief?","(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the trustee may avoid a transfer of property of the estate-- (1) that occurs after the commencement of the case; and (2)(A) that is authorized only under section 303(f) or 542(c) of this title; or (B) that is not authorized under this title or by the court."
"Can a trustee recover more under 553(b) than the amount actually set off by a creditor?","In order to determine whether a creditor improved its position, the court must compare the amount of debt outstanding to the value of the collateral securing the debt at the beginning and the end of the preference period. See Smith v. Assocs. Commercial Corp. (In re Clark Pipe and Supply Co., Inc.), 893 F.2d 693 (5th Cir.1990); see also S.Rep. No. 95989, 88 (1978), as reprinted in U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5874. In other words, a creditor will be deemed to have improved its position if its deficiency on the petition date is less than its deficiency 90 days prior to the petition date."
"When will a creditor's motion to dismiss for abuse be denied in a Chapter 7 case?","Section 707(b)(3). Section 707(b) is applicable only if the Debtor's debts are primarily consumer debts,18 and only then may the Court consider whether the granting of relief would be an abuse of Chapter 7. See In re Sekendur, 334 B.R. 609, 618 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.2005); In re Mooney, 313 B.R. 709, 713 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2004). This is why Official Form B 22A provides a method to indicate a debtor's debts are primarily business debts, and instructs the debtor, if so, to immediately proceed to the bottom of the form. Here, the Debtor checked the box on Form B 22A indicating his debts are primarily business debts, thereby avoiding the presumption of abuse which otherwise could have arisen under  707(b)(2)(A)(i). See Doc. # 1."
"When can an undersecured creditor's claim against a debtor's receivables be treated as secured?","Section 1111(b)(1)(A) treats a claim secured by a lien on property as recourse regardless of whether the underlying transaction or applicable law provides for recourse. A nonrecourse creditor is a creditor who has agreed to look only to its collateral for satisfaction of its debt and does not have any right to seek payment of any deficiency from a debtor's other assets. See, In re Dan Hixson Chevrolet Co., 20 B.R. 108, 110111 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1982) (nonrecourse means that the lienor may look only to the property subject to his lien to satisfy his debt and cannot look to the debtor personally for payment.) A recourse creditor has the right to seek payment of a deficiency in the value of its collateral from the debtor's other assets. C. Averch and M. Collins, Norton Bankruptcy Law Advisor, May 1993, 3, citing, Nelson and Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law  2.1, 1819 (2d ed. 1985)."

Debtor's plan uses a value for the mobile home of $27,100 and therefore, confirmation of Debtor's plan filed January 22, 2016 is denied. Debtor is given fourteen (14) days from the date of entry of this order to propose an amended plan."
"When are bankruptcy debtors precluded from contesting state court judgments?","In Burton, this Court considered the requirements of the first prong of the Brunner test: The initial prong of the Brunner inquiry requires this Court to assess whether the debtor has proven he cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a minimal standard of living for himself and his dependents if forced to repay the student loans. In re Ekenasi, 325 F.3d at 546 (citing Brunner, 831 F.2d at 396). In making this assessment, a court should examine the debtor's standard of living, with a view toward ascertaining whether the debtor has attempted to minimize the expenses of himself and his dependents. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs. v. Smitley (In re Smitley ), 347 F.3d 109, 117 (4th Cir.2003) (citing In re Ekenasi, 325 F.3d at 546; Rice v. U.S. (In re Rice ), 78 F.3d 1144, 1149 (6th Cir.1996)). In contemplation of what constitutes a minimal standard of living, some courts have equated poverty with such a standard. McCormack v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp. (In re McCormack ), No. 9910637, 2000 WL 33710278, at *4 (Bankr.D.S.C. July 3, 2000) (citing Griffin v. Eduserv (In re Griffin ), 197 B.R. 144, 147 (Bankr.E.D.Okla.1996)). Other courts have not required that debtors live in poverty in order to satisfy the first Brunner prong, instead taking into consideration the debtor's current income and expenses in determining whether the debtor and her dependents, if any, will be able to sustain a minimal standard of living. Id. (citing Ammirati v. Nellie Mae, Inc. (In re Ammirati), 187 B.R. 902, 907 (D.S.C.1995), aff'd 85 F.3d 615 (4th Cir.1996)). Specifically, [t]he bankruptcy court must determine what amount is minimally necessary to ensure that the debtor's needs for care, including food, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment are met. Salinas v. United Student Aid Funds, Inc. (In re Salinas), 240 B.R. 305, 314 (Bankr.W.D.Wis.1999) (citing In re Rice, 78 F.3d at 1149).

"Can a chapter 13 plan be confirmed where the debtor didn't disclose prior bankruptcies?","Here, the Debtor's Statement of Related Cases information Required by LBR 10152 filed in his case failed to disclose the prior bankruptcy filings by the Debtor's wholly owned subsidiaries, Ridgeline and Sarduis, which are affiliates of the Debtor pursuant to 11 U.S.C. section 101(2). Second, as set forth in the Trustee's objection to confirmation and request to dismiss, the Debtor has failed to disclose any unemployment income in his Schedule I. Last, as set forth in the APT objection to confirmation and request to dismiss, Debtor has failed to disclose his interest in affiliate ThreeC's Residential & Commercial Builder, LLC. IV. CONCLUSION Accordingly, for the reasons stated above and as otherwise stated in the objections filed by the Trustee and APT, confirmation of the Debtor's Second Plan is denied (and in the alternative, confirmation of the Fifth Plan is denied), and the request to dismiss the Debtor's chapter 13 case is granted, without prejudice. A separate order shall be entered denying confirmation and dismissing the case in accordance with this memorandum of decision."
"How does the rejection of rail car leases function in bankruptcy in North dakota?","To be deemed an administrative expense, the expense must:  (1) arise out of a transaction between the creditor and the bankrupt's trustee or debtor-in-possession; and (2) benefit the debtor-in-possession in the operation of the business.

"Can a chapter 13 plan be filed in good faith but proposed in bad fath?","Preemption is grounded in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which provides that the Constitution and federal laws enacted under it shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. U.S. Const. Art. VI,  2. Federal courts, including the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, have identified two basic types of preemption: field preemption and conflict preemption. See, e.g., Worm v. American Cyanamid Co., 970 F.2d 1301, 1304 (4th Cir.1992). Field preemption turns on discovering the intent of Congress. Id. Even if Congress does not expressly state its intent to supplant[ ] state authority in a particular field[,] ... its intent to do so may be inferred from its regulating so pervasively in the field as not to leave sufficient vacancy within which any state can act. Id. Conflict preemption occurs where a state law actually conflicts with federal law. Id. In the bankruptcy context, a court determining whether a non-bankruptcy state law is preempted by the Bankruptcy Code should ask: (1) whether the state law is expressly preempted by Congress; (2) whether Congress intended to occupy the entire field so as to preempt state laws that might be applicable in that area; (3) whether the state law conflicts with the federal statutes such that the state law cannot be given effect; or (4) whether the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. Johnston v. Telecheck Servs., Inc. (In re Johnston), 362 B.R. 730, 735 (Bankr.N.D. W. Va. 2007) (citations omitted) (examining preemption of state laws by the Bankruptcy Code)."
"What is the standard for personal jurisdiction over an international defendant?","These factors support the constitutional exercise of personal jurisdiction over the Banks. With regard to the first factor, courts have held that the burden imposed on a defendant forced to litigate far from home is substantially mitigated by the conveniences of modern communication and transportation. Bank Brussels, 305 F.3d at 12930. With regard to the second factor, the United States has a strong interest in adjudicating claims that arise under its Bankruptcy Code so that both creditors and debtors can obtain the remedies and relief that the United States Congress has determined are fair and equitable. Picard v. Chais (In re Bernard L. Madoff Investment Secs. LLC), 440 B.R. 274, 281 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2010) (stating that [t]he United States has a strong interest in applying the provisions of its bankruptcy code); U.S. Lines, Inv. v. GAC Marine Fuels Ltd. (In re McLean Indus. Inc.), 68 B.R. 690, 699 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1986) (finding that United States had strong interest in adjudicating dispute because it arose solely under [the United States' bankruptcy] laws and concern[ed] a vital protection provided by federal statute to those who seek to reorganize). Indeed, it does not seem prudential to allow foreign creditors to potentially obtain priority over domestic creditors based simply on their foreign status. Third, the Committee has a strong interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, and it is unclear whether it would be able to bring a similar causes of action to those grounded in the United States bankruptcy code in a non-U.S. forum. Although it is true that the Banks must defend themselves in a foreign legal system, and this weighs in the Banks' favor, this factor alone is not dispositive, otherwise a United States court could never constitutionally exercise jurisdiction over a non-U.S. entity. See Asahi, 480 U.S. at 114, 107 S.Ct. 1026. Given that the balance of factors weigh in the Committee's favor, the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the Banks' in this particular action comports with constitutional due process."
"What is the proper valuation method under 11 U.S.C.S.  506(a) for a bank's junior lien?","The court emphasizes the limited nature of this holding that, in the circumstances of this case, valuing collateral as of plan confirmation is not correct. This holding should apply only to proceedings in the same procedural posture as the case here: adversary proceedings brought by a debtor to strip off a junior lien on the debtor's residence under  506(a) & (d) (proceedings the propriety of which is in some doubt, see supra notes 2 & 5). This court's holding in this case should not apply to the valuation of collateral in other contexts in the bankruptcy code, which may present other considerations. CONCLUSION For the reasons explained above, the judgment of the bankruptcy court is reversed and the case is remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion."
"Will fraudulent transfer claims be dismissed due to expiration of the statute of limitations?","Based upon the plain language of Section 546(a), the fraudulent conveyance count is unquestionably beyond the statute of limitations and should be dismissed. Here, the Trustee's Amended Complaint states that the date of the Debtor's bankruptcy filing, which is also the date for the order of relief, was October 1, 1998. (Amended Complaint, ¦ 6). The Trustee filed his original complaint on March 29, 2011, more than twelve years after the date of the order of relief. The Trustee was not appointed within two years of the bankruptcy filing and, therefore, the Trustee cannot avail himself of  546(a)(1)(B), granting him one year from the date of his appointment to file an action."
"Will a case be dismissed as filed for a non-bankruptcy purpose and as part of a ""scorched-earth"" strategy to avoid the consequences of their extra-bankruptcy litigation?","Thus, under the first part of the Padilla inquiry, because other Code provisions contemplate (1) taking refuge from the jurisdiction of another court; (2) engaging in a “scorched earth” tactic against a particular creditor; and (3) making misrepresentations in bankruptcy filings, we conclude that there is no “cause” to dismiss the Shermans' bankruptcy petition because of any such behavior. To respect the complex statutory scheme that Congress has created to deal with malfeasance associated with bankruptcy petitions, we are loath to hold that a factor constitutes “cause” unless the Bankruptcy Code regime is incapable of righting wrongs of the kind alleged. Our holding hardly leaves the SEC unprotected, as the SEC could have pursued—and did pursue—several vehicles for protecting itself. In particular, the SEC was protected against the use of bankruptcy to avoid the jurisdiction of another court because, under § 362(b)(4), it was not subject to the automatic stay. Further, the SEC could have sought to avoid some of the Shermans' prepetition transfers as preferences had it been concerned that the Shermans had engaged in a “scorched earth” tactic. In addition, the SEC could have tried to protect itself against misrepresentations in the bankruptcy petition by filing a complaint under § 727(a)(4)(A). Moreover, the SEC may have been able—and may still be able—to avoid discharge of the contempt and disgorgement judgments under § 523. Finally, had the SEC been concerned about an abuse of process, it could have sought a remedy under the bankruptcy court's inherent authority to sanction debtors who file bankruptcy petitions in bad faith. See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43–46, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991); Dyer, 322 F.3d at 1190 n. 14, 1196; Caldwell v. Unified Capital Corp. (In re Rainbow Magazine, Inc.), 77 F.3d 278, 284 (9th Cir.1996)."
"Is a trustee's turnover power solely restricted to recovering bankruptcy estate property, or its value, from entities having ""possession, custody, or control"" of the property at the time the motion for turnover is filed?","The trustee finally argues that our interpretation of the statute renders § 542(c) superfluous. Section 542(c) provides that an entity which lacks actual knowledge or notice of the bankruptcy case is allowed to transfer property of the estate. The trustee characterizes § 542(c) as “an affirmative defense” to a turnover action. Such a defense, the trustee argues, would not be necessary if an entity had to possess property of the estate before a trustee could initiate an action to compel turnover. This argument incorrectly assumes that § 542(c) carves out an exception to the possible universe of defendants in a turnover proceeding, but the function of § 542(c) is to limit the turnover duty created in § 542(a), rather than to limit the possible defendants in a turnover proceeding. Whether or not an entity happens to be exempted under § 542(c) from the duty to turn over property of the estate, both the bankruptcy code and precode practice dictate that an entity lacking present possession of property cannot be the subject of a motion to compel turnover. An entity can thus fall outside the exemption of § 542(c) and be subject to the turnover duty, but still not be a proper defendant in a turnover proceeding. Although Pyatt would have had the duty to turn over all the money in his checking account before his checks were honored, the trustee cannot now compel him to turn over property which is no longer within his control."
"Can 105(a) be used to provide relief to anyone other than the debtor?","24 Section 362 of the Code, which stays actions against the debtor and against property of the estate, does not forbid actions against a debtor's codefendants. Therefore, the sole statutory basis for issuance of a stay against a debtor's codefendants is section 105 of the Code.47 Under this provision, bankruptcy courts have used injunctive power to provide temporary protection for a debtor's codefendants. See, e.g., Otero Mills, Inc. v. Security Bank & Trust (In re Otero Mills, Inc.), 21 B.R. 777 (Bankr.D.N.Mex.), aff'd, 25 B.R. 1018 (D.N.Mex.1982). Since the Fifth Circuit has recently explicated the limited nature of discretionary stays, there is no reason to re-examine this legal area in depth. See GATX Aircraft Corp. v. N/V Courtney Leigh, 768 F.2d 711, 71517 (5th Cir.1985) (A stay can be justified only if, based on a balancing of the parties' interests, there is a clear inequity to the suppliant who is required to defend while another action remains unresolved and if the order granting a stay can be framed to contain reasonable limits on its duration.); See also Wedgeworth v. Fibreboard Corp., 706 F.2d 541 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, injunctive relief in favor of non-debtors must be considered an extraordinary remedy to be granted only when a significant and direct impact on the reorganization proceedings is threatened. The movant must make out a clear showing of hardship and adverse impact on the reorganization case if there is even a fair possibility that the stay will prejudice an adverse party. In re Arrow Huss, Inc., 51 B.R. 853 (Bankd.D.Utah 1985), citing, Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 255, 57 S.Ct. 163, 81 L.Ed. 153 (1936)."
"Should the assumption or rejection of an executory contract by the trustee depend upon performance or non-performance of the bankruptcy party?","In all chapters except chapter 7, an executory contract may be assumed or rejected at any time before plan confirmation. A party to such a contract is entitled to seek an earlier decision by requesting that the court fix an earlier deadline to a determination to be made, but the court is not required to grant such a request. 11 U.S.C.  365(d)(2); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 6006(b). As with  365(a) and 1123(b)(2), the language of  365(d)(2) is permissivethe operative verb phrases being may assume or reject and may order the trustee to determinein a manner that leaves room for ride through."
"Does the obligation of a debtor to refrain from selling software packages under an exclusive licensing agreement make a contract executory?","The unperformed, continuing core obligations of notice and forbearance in licensing made the contract executory as to RMF. In Fenix Cattle Co. v. Silver (In re Select-A-Seat Corp.), 625 F.2d 290, 292 (9th Cir.1980), the court found that an obligation of a debtor to refrain from selling software packages under an exclusive licensing agreement made a contract executory as to the debtor notwithstanding the continuing *1046 obligation was only one of forbearance. Although the license to Lubrizol was not exclusive, RMF owed the same type of unperformed continuing duty of forbearance arising out of the most favored licensee clause running in favor of Lubrizol. Breach of that duty would clearly constitute a material breach of the agreement."
"Can you assume a long-term commercial real estate lease before confirmation of a reorganization plan?","In Congress's own words, the deadline provisions of 11 U.S.C.  365(d)(4) are intended to set a bright line regarding how much time the trustee has to decide whether to assume or reject a lease. Congress does not specify the manner in which the trustee is to announce the decision, although case law consistently holds that the mere filing of a motion to assume is sufficient. If we were to adopt the Appellant's interpretation of 11 U.S.C.  365(d)(4), such certainty would be destroyed. The period within which the trustee could consider assumption or rejection would vary widely, depending on the vagaries of a particular bankruptcy court's caseload and local procedures. Theoretically at least, a trustee could file a motion to assume a lease on the day the debtor filed its bankruptcy petition and, because of events outside the trustee's control, still fail to obtain court approval of the motion before the deadline. Conversely, allowing trustees to signify their intentions merely by filing motions to assume clearly satisfies the goal of 11 U.S.C.  365(d)(4) to let lessors know the trustees' intention with respect to their property within a reasonable, certain time frame."
"Can a creditor ever contact a debtor about reaffirming its debt without violating 11 U.S.C. 362(a)(6)?","To be sure, there is a fine line between hard-nosed negotiations and predatory tacticsand if the automatic stay is to have any bite, it must forfend against the latter. Courts have labored long to plot this line. The most sensible ruleand one that we endorseis that a creditor may discuss and negotiate terms for reaffirmation with a debtor without violating the automatic stay as long as the creditor refrains from coercion or harassment. Cox v. Zale Del., Inc., 239 F.3d 910, 912 (7th Cir.2001); Pertuso v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 233 F.3d 417, 423 (6th Cir.2000). We believe that this measured approach gives effect to all parts of the statutory scheme, affording all parties a reasonable opportunity to consummate binding reaffirmation agreements while at the same time shielding debtors from unseemly creditor practices. Accordingly, we hold that, while the automatic stay is in effect, a creditor may engage in post-petition negotiations pertaining to a bankruptcy-related reaffirmation agreement so long as the creditor does not engage in coercive or harassing tactics."
"How does homestead law handle the case in which the debtor's home and her business, or some part of it, are located at the same place?","However, even under homestead exemption laws, which like the District of Columbia's residence exemption law, are residence-use-restricted, courts have held that a debtor may conduct his business on his homestead without losing his homestead exemption. See In re MacLeod, 295 B.R. 1 (Bankr.D.Me.2003) (under Maine statute limiting homestead exemption to real or personal property that the debtor ... uses as a residence ...., 14 M.R.S.A.  4422(1)(A), [r]esidential use may extend ... to incidental business use, like a home office); In re Nelson, 225 B.R. 508 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1998) (applying Florida homestead exemption law which is residence-use-restricted, where debtor conducted landscaping business on his property, the court stated: There is nothing within Florida law that provides that, should a person conduct business on his homestead property, he loses his homestead status.); Edward Leasing Corp. v. Uhlig, 652 F.Supp. 1409 (S.D.Fla.1987). See also In re Haning, 252 B.R. 799 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2000) (following Nelson and Uhlig); In re McLachlan, 266 B.R. 220 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2001); Uniform Exemptions Act 1976  4, Comment (1) (Nor does commercial use of property occupied as a home deprive it of its exempt character. [citing S. Thompson, Homestead and Exemption Laws  121123 (1878); R. Waples, Homestead and Exemption 23538 (1893); Vukowich, Debtors' Exemption Rights, 62 Geo. L.J. 779, 805 (1974).] ). See also In re Shepardson, 28 F.2d 353 (S.D.Cal.1928): Where the claimant is established upon the property for the main purpose of engaging in a certain business, and uses a portion thereof for dwelling purposes only, that he may be convenient to that business, it may not be said that the property comes within the purpose of the statute allowing homestead exemption. On the other hand, where the place is primarily the home of the family, and some business is engaged in on the premises in an incidental way, the conduct of such a business does not deprive the owner of the right to his homestead claim."
